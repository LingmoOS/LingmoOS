# The shell "clock-format" is set to "none", in order to have stable
#  display output, independant from the time. The display output can
# then be reliably checked with VKMS CRC.
# "startup-animation" and "close-animation" are set to "none" for
# faster transitions (fade animations with a software GLES
# implementation tend to be slow).
# Finally, we force the smallest standard display output mode
# resolution, again for faster test execution.

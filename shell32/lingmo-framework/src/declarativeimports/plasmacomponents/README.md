Plasma Components 2 is a style for QtQuick Controls 1.

As QtQuick Controls 1 is not going to be part of Qt6, this folder should be considered feature frozen with no new behavioural changes or new API.

Use of components in this module in client code is still allowed, as not all features are identical to their QtQuickControls2 counterparts.

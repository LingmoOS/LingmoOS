     * automatically initiated.
     *
     * Some examples:
     *
     * - When the user types text in a search field, wait no longer than this duration after
     *   the user completes typing before starting the search
     * - When loading data which would commonly arrive rapidly enough to not require interaction,
     *   wait this long before showing a spinner
     *
     * This might seem an arbitrary number, but given the psychological effect that three
     * seconds seems to be what humans consider a moment (and in the case of waiting for
     * something to happen, a moment is that time when you think "this is taking a bit long,
     * isn't it?"), the idea is to postpone for just before such a conceptual moment. The reason
     * for the two seconds, rather than three, is to function as a middle ground: Not long enough
     * that the user would think that something has taken too long, for also not so fast as to
     * happen too soon.

Plasma Applet Template
----------------------

-- Namespace adaption --

Each Plasma plugin has a unique identifier, which is also used to find related
resources (like the translation catalogs).
To avoid naming collisions, Plasma plugins use a reverse domain name notation
for that identifier:

* org.kde.plasma.* - plugins coming from Plasma modules
* org.kde.*        - plugins coming from other software from KDE
* $(my.domain).*   - plugins of your 3rd-party

The generated code uses the "org.kde.plasma" namespace for the plugin identifier.
As this namespace is reserved for use by plugins part of Plasma modules, you will
need to adapt this namespace if you are writing a plugin which is not intended to
end up in the Plasma modules.


-- Build instructions --

cd /where/your/applet/is/generated
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=MYPREFIX .. 
make 
make install

(MYPREFIX is where you install your Plasma setup, replace it accordingly)

Restart plasma to load the applet 
(in a terminal type: 
kquitapp plasmashell 
and then
plasmashell)

or view it with 
plasmoidviewer -a YourAppletName

libplasma 3.0 / KDE 4.2
=======================

libplasma
---------
* Build
    * libplasma has moved to kdelibs from kdebase-workspace and as such there is no longer a need to use FindPlasma.cmake. FindKDE4 now provides all the necessary plasma CMake bits needed, and using libplasma does not create a kdebase-workspace dependency for your application anymore.

* Features
    * Symbol Versioning: limit loading of plugins to those that match the libplasma version
    * NEW: ToolTipManager for Plasma style tooltips
    * NEW: Wallpaper plugins for Containments
    * NEW: Context for coordinating and publishing Context information, such as the current Activity or phsyical location
    * Applet
        * sizeHintChanged() signal. A containment (such as a panel) can adjust its size based on changed sizehints of an applet
        * ContextConstraint events and access to the current Context object
        * Shortcut editor in Applet configuration dialog allows setting of global shortcuts per-widget
        * NEW: Plasma::Extender and Plasma::ExtenderItem, allowing visual, relocatable extensions to Applet
        * NEW: PopupApplet, which switches between an icon with a popup in a Horizontal/Vertical containment (such as a panel) and the widget directly on the canvas in a Planer containment (such as a desktop), the icon can be replaced with custom graphics or widgets by the implementation
    * Containment
        * Support dropping of arbitrary data if the mimetypes are supported by an applet
        * Activity naming and Context support
        * Toolbox can be positioned in any corner or edge
        * Toolbox actions are displayed as an always open toolbar when zoomed out for improved usability
    * Corona
        * addOffscreenWidget/removeOffscreenWidget: manage canvas items that should not appear in a primary view (e.g. Extenders)
        * "screen" information querying added to Corona to allow different approaches for viewports; e.g. using KWindowSystem and QDesktopWidget for the Plasma shell, but window coordinates for plasmodviewer or other non-desktop apps.
    * Package system
        * PackageStructure supports arbitrary URIs (in addition to auto-discovery for package) structure description files.
        * Package removal
        * Package browsing interface can be provided by the PackageStructure plugin, allowing for 3rd party widget collectionsto offer online browsing and fetching customizations
    * FrameSvg
        * setting the margins via in-SVG hints
        * paintPanel API additions to make it more like QPainter and Plasma::Svg
    * Runners
        * TryExec key in .desktop file now supported, allowing runners that rely on an external application to be conditional loaded at runtime
    * Service
        * Allow enabling/disabling of operations at runtime
        * Associate widgets with operations
    * Theme
        * Support compressed SVGs (*.svgz)
        * Supports a pixmap cache and a SVG element rects cache for faster startup
    * Widgets
        * NEW: Plasma::Slider based on QSlider
        * NEW: Plasma::TabBar based on QTabBar, usable as both a standalone tabbar or as a tabwidget
        * NEW: Plasma::Frame used to visually group widgets
        * NEW: Plasma::TreeView used to put tree views or simple list in the canvas
        * NEW: Plasma::BusyWidget used to indicate the loading of something
        * NEW: Plasma::ToolButton based on QToolButton
        * Plasma::PushButton is svg-themed

* Significant Fixes
    * WebContent painting update synchronization (fixes, among other things, scrolling)
    * Prevent crash when Containment that AppletBrowser is associated with is deleted
    * Applet handles work with all icon sizes (user system settings)
    * Fix View so that when a new activity is added, don't move more than necessary;
      fixes dragging lock
    * Dramatically fewer full paints by properly watching the exposed rect area, which for full screen Containments or large/complex Applets is quite significant in terms of performance
    * Fix on-exit crashes related to focus handling issues in QGraphicsView
    * Prevention of premature calls to Applet::constraintsEvent
    * Applets now resize in "real time" without the pixelation
    * Numerous crash fixes pushed upstream to QGraphicsView as well (focus resetting, scene queries on deletion..)

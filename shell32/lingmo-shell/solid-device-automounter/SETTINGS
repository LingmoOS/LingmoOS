This document describes the kded_device_automounterrc settings and how they affect behavior.

General/AutomountUnknownDevices:If true, all devices get mounted regardless of
				the other conditions.

General/AutomountOnPlugin:	When this is set to true, devices might get
				mounted when they are inserted.

General/AutomountOnLogin:	When true, devices might get mounted when
				the module is loaded.

General/AutomountEnabled:	Determines if automounting is globally enabled.

Devices/<dev>/EverMounted:	Used to determine if a device is 'known'. A device
				is known if it has ever been mounted.

Devices/<dev>/LastSeenMounted:	Saves the 'mounted' state between desktop
				sessions. Devices with this set to true are
				automagically remounted when the module loads.

Devices/<dev>/ForceAutomount:	Determines if this device should get
				automounted regardless of anything else,
				including AutomountEnabled.

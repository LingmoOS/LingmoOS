This is new project to replace keyboard (kcmmisc) and kxkb 
to manage keyboard hardware configuration and layouts.

Components:

kcm_init:
* no kcm_init - all initialization (including after keyboard hot-plug) is done by kded daemon

Keyboard daemon:
* configures keyboard layouts on start
* provides DBUS API "org.kde.KXKB/kxkb"
* listens to window/desktop switching if layout switch mode is not global
* listens to new keyboard devices and reinitializes keyboard layouts and hardware settings
* listens to Global KDE Shortcut to switch layouts
* listens to Global Shortcut settings change
* listens to keyboard configuration changes
* provides systray icon for layout

Keyboard applet:
* displays current layout with text and (optionally flag)
* allows to toggle layouts by click or set them with context menu

Layout widget:
* displays current layout with text embedded in another widget (e.g. lock dialog)
* currently only short text (no flag or long text)
* dynamically loaded as a plugin

KCM Module:
* allows to configure keyboard hardware, layouts and xkb options (advanced)

Advantages (over old code):
* One UI module to configure keyboard layouts and hardware
* Allows to configure keyboard model/xkb options without configuring layouts
* Less cluttered layout configuration control (add layout is separate)
* Layout control/DBus interface is separate from the indicator
* Does not require libxklvier
* Takes language names from iso-codes project
* Takes country names/translations from xkeyboard-config project
* Information about current layouts is always taken from X server, so should be more robust
* Cleaner code (rewritten from scratch)
* Due to many points above should start faster (though no benchmarks performed)

New features:
* Allow selection of keyboard layout by language

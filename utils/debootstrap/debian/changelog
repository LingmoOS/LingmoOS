  * optimize code, make debootstrap faster (Closes: #871835)
    - use hash instead of grep for each line we read
    - we can use elsif, because the line can't match both patterns
    - There's no need to print the dependencies for each package separately,
      if when later do sort|uniq, so just collect all dependencies in a hash
      and print them at the end
    - do not read all lines of the Packages file into the perl scripts,
      egrep is used for filtering only the lines we need to read, since egrep
      is faster than perl, this save a lot of time
    - speed up by using grep -P and setting LC_ALL=C
    - automatic detect if grep support perl regex
    - in this part, we only need the package name and priority this makes
      another little speedup, since the perl part need less lines to parse

    setup_dynamic_devices mounts the appropriate filesystems which provide
    dynamic device nodes for the architectures which need one in
    debootstrap (kfreebsd and hurd).
    This fixes a bug in --second-stage introduced in 1.0.34 and exposed
    by the devices-related changes of 1.0.76: the second stage debootstrap
    runs "dpkg --print-architecture >/dev/null" at the very beginning of
    the program when /dev is still empty, so it creates an empty regular
    file in place of /dev/null and this will cause mknod to fail later.

    debootstrap's own support for doing this outside d-i with gettext's
    shell bindings has been completely broken ever since it was added in
    2003, though, and nobody has complained. Fixing it would require a big
    pile of infrastructure and some non-trivial patches, plus arranging to
    copy all the translations over from base-installer, and it just doesn't
    seem worth it, so lose the cruft (LP: #188690).
  * Export PATH, just to make sure. It isn't necessarily exported by shells
    running from init=/bin/sh or similar, and the upstream bash maintainer
    is unwilling to export it by default; it's easy enough to do so here

debootstrap (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Anthony Towns ]
  * Make debootstrap team maintained under the d-i banner.

    d-i group).
  * Make pkgdetails.c not need C99 extensions. (Closes: Bug#398977)
  * Fix am_doing_phase implementation in debootstrap script. Thanks to
    Tero Janka for spotting the problem and the fix. (Closes: Bug#409881)

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Drop support for sarge from the udeb.
  * Update README.Debian:
    - One todo item is done. (I think cross-strap is too, but unsure.)
    - Reword NMU policy to note that it's team-maintained now.
  * ACK my prior NMU. Closes: #418600
  * If /dev/MAKEDEV DNE, as on certain s390 machines, use /sbin/MAKEDEV.
    Closes: #420908
    Note that /dev/MAKEDEV is still the correct location, and is still tried
    first so that building works on all FHS systems, as noted in #190239.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add support for Ubuntu dapper (Closes: #342838), edgy, feisty, and
    gutsy. Exclude everything but gutsy from the udeb.
  * Fix "deboostrap" typo in debootstrap(8) (thanks, Adam Conrad).
  * Fix "htp" typo in temporary /etc/apt/sources.list.
  * Drop support for woody from the udeb too.
  * When removing $TARGET/debootstrap, debootstrap.log is still open as
    stdout/stderr and needs to remain so, but after unlinking it some NFS
    servers implement this by a temporary file in the same directory, which
    makes it impossible to rmdir that directory. Moving it instead works
    around the problem (thanks, Steven McCoy;
    https://launchpad.net/bugs/65003).
  * Fix formatting error in debootstrap(8) (.R is not a macro).
  * Reorganise scripts into scripts/debian/ and scripts/ubuntu/ directories
    in the source tree to declutter the top level.
  * Add default_mirror function; reorganise the debootstrap script a little
    so that it works. Set the default mirror for Ubuntu suites to
    http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu, and the default mirror for Debian
    etch/lenny/sid architectures other than amd64 and i386 to
    http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian (per ajt; see bug #363049).
  * Add devices created by fd to devices-std.tar.gz, so that
    /dev/std{in,out,err} is available conveniently in chroots with /proc and
    /dev/pts mounted (thanks, Matthias Klose).
  * Document --keyring and --make-tarball. (Closes: #368988)
  * Update Ubuntu mirrors: warty/hoary/breezy => old-releases.ubuntu.com,
    unsupported architectures => ports.ubuntu.com.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Bump to 1.0.0. Nobody uses debootstrap in production, do they?

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove the extended package description (aka bloat) from the udeb.

debootstrap (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sid script updated:
    - Determine base dynamically (Priority: required for required packages,
      Priority: important for base packages, Build-Essential: yes for buildd
      variant base). (Closes: Bug#88984, Bug#193134)
    - Use fine grained dpkg progress display, thanks again to Colin Watson.
      (Closes: Bug#229314, Bug#231109, Bug#244563)

  * dpkg output (etc) goes to /var/log/bootstrap.log in the target, rather
    than stdout. This is probably difficult for frontends to capture
    at present.

  * Parsing of Packages file sped up. (Yay!)

  * debootstrap.deb now arch: all (Closes: Bug#122465, Bug#131552)

    - none of the above applies to udebs yet; though the devices.tar.gz
      change will eventually

debootstrap (0.1.17.20) unstable; urgency=medium

debootstrap (0.1.17.16) unstable; urgency=medium

  * NMU
  * Drop aptitude from the sid script (base-config 1.51 dropped its dependency
    on it) and libsigc++0 (which was only needed for aptitude). This makes
    "pbuilder create --distribution sid" work again. (Closes: #177221, #177998).

debootstrap (0.1.17.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * sarge: Removed shellutils, textutils and added coreutils instead.
    Verified that the result works for "pbuilder create --distribution sarge"
    (Closes: #163789)
    Fileutils is still in there for now, due to sarge's debconf versioned
    dependency on it.

debootstrap (0.1.17.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * The "it didn't change the way the installer worked" release.
  * Makefile: create $(DESTDIR)/usr/share/man/man8 before attempting to
    install a file to it (Closes: #139543)
  * functions: fix race condition in smallyes() implementation; thanks to Matt
    Zimmerman for the analysis.  "Sometimes, dpkg finishes executing before
    smallyes runs, and it loops forever while echo fails repeatedly due to the
    broken pipe."  To fix this race, we simply swap the loop condition and
    body, so that if the echo fails, smallyes() exits cleanly.  I further
    changed "true" to ":" to save the expense of an extra process for shells
    where "true" is not a built-in.

  * Don't use PIPESTATUS to work out if wget succeeded, since that's a
    bashism and we're seriously not allowed bashisms. Duh. This should
    help with all those "Malformed release" problems. Thanks to Phil
    Blundell and Chris Tillman for spotting this. (Closes: Bug#136729)

  * Apply patch from Matt Zimmerman to get rid of some irritating warnings
    that can show up sometimes due to sed getting it's output stream closed
    on it. (Closes: Bug#131478)

  * Don't use "export foo=bar" on a single line since it's a bashism.
    (Closes: Bug#138187)

  * Made the "smallyes" usage independent of --boot-floppies. Too much
    code duplication otherwise.

  * Install ipchains on arches that have 2.2.x kernels by default, and
    iptables on arches that have 2.4.x kernels by default. Some arches
    have both. (Closes: Bug#134478)

  * Don't rm malformed Release files, rename them to something obvious
    instead so people can have a hope at seeing what's going on. (Closes:
    Bug#131756)

  * Error out on missing entries in Release files. (Closes: Bug#136886)

  * Fix basedeb creation to not bother building devices tarball. (Closes:
    Bug#137243)

  * Workaround for ldconfig no longer needed, so removed. (Closes: Bug#135819)
  * Workaround for /dev/initctl was never needed and stupid, so removed.

  * Make sure devices.tar.gz is gzip -9'ed. (Closes: Bug#136687)

  * Use any "main" components found in Release file, eg "main",
    "non-US/main", "local/main". (Closes: Bug#116801)

  * Add parted to base for ia64. (Closes: Bug#138246)

  * Moved the "successful!" message and sleep hack for boot-floppies from
    the woody script to the debootstrap script itself.

    needed for modern device drivers (Joysticks, USB, Scanners)
  * added pppoeconf to the packages list, better choice for DSL users

  * Fix progress bar hooks to enable proper progress on basedebs.tgz
    installation as well as actual base installation and extraction.
  * trap signals so cleanup is still performed.
  * When in --boot-floppies mode echo a Success info message to stdout, so
    it will show up on /dev/tty4, this is so users watching tty4 stop
    being confused when things just stop at completion.
  * Replace $TARGET/sbin/start-stop-daemon with a shell script instead of
    /bin/true, this shell script announces that its a fake noop version so
    users will know whats wrong if debootstrap aborts before completion.

debootstrap (0.1.15.7) unstable; urgency=high

  * non-maintainer upload
  * when reporting errors in 'in_target', don't chop down to the first

  * woody: when in boot-floppies mode, provide more user-friendly warning
    messages, using new 'in_target_msg' function
  * woody: more info messages for the core/required/base package
    installation part
  * instead of 'ln -s' we should be using 'ln -sf'; this would prevent

  * Add libpcap0 to base, ppp depends on it now. (Closes: #114056)

  * From Adam Di Carlo:
  * Potato installation on non-i386 was broken, need libc6
    (closes: #112778); however, there are other ways the Potato base
    install doesn't represent quite what Potato boot-floppies would
    consider base
  * apply patch from Tommi Virtanen which improves the 'smallyes'
    function; apparently this fixes a console-tools postinst loop,

  * Remove syslinux from base (Closes: #107447)
  * Eliminate useless warning about creating exim.conf (Closes: #99229)
  * Don't use "here documents" (they create tmp files in /tmp which could
    be very well be full on boot-floppies).
  * Don't use echo -n it is not portable.
  * Set umask to 022.
  * All patches from Ethan Benson, I am just the builder!

debootstrap (0.1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make in_target_nofail kill stderr. No more "/dev/pts: not mounted" error.
    Yay. :)

  * Refactor woody, potato and slink scripts; do away with
    woody.debs. Change the way the scripts work. (Now they define
    functions which debootstrap calls. Much nicer)
  * Support --download-only option.
  * Support resuming downloads of Release and Packages files, even gzipped
    ones.
  * Support null: (Packages files assumed to be named for a debootstrap.invalid
    host)
  * Always use the deboostrap.invalid name, and use that in
    /etc/apt/sources.list. Remove /etc/apt/sources.list after the base
    system is build.
  * All this should be enough to support basedeb.tgz installs on
    debootstrap's behalf. Some more stuff would be useful, but isn't
    immediately necessary. (Closes: Bug#102217)

  * Add ia64 support and fix libc6 == libc6.1 problem. (Closes: Bug#101829)

  * Be a little more careful with permissions on devs tarball. Hopefully.
    (Closes: Bug#102308)

  * Don't worry if md5sum from stdin adds a "  -" after the md5sum. Should
    make debootstrap more usable on non-Debian Linuxes.

    be recent enough. (Closes: Bug#97713)
  * Check for malformed release files. Thanks to Martin Michlmayr for the
    patch. (Closes: Bug#97707)
  * Use --force-confold when installing base. That is: if you want the
    conffile from the package to be there at the end, don't create a
    file in the first place. I'm not convinced this is right.
    (Closes: Bug#99025)

debootstrap (0.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Abort build on devfs systems (MAKEDEV fails for no good reason)
    (Closes: Bug#97713)

  * Add support for mips and mipsel (Closes: Bug#97711)
  * Add some support for hppa (install palo in base)

  * Don't install ldso (Closes: Bug#97708)

    (Closes: Bug#98050)
  * Do install libdb3 and libcap1.
  * Install klogd too. (But only as part of base. Move sysklogd to base too)

  * Setup a dummy lilo.conf on i386 only. (Closes: Bug#97710, Bug#98052)

  * Trim a trailing / for target and url.

debootstrap (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add adduser and base-config into base. base-config unfortunately depends
    on perl instead of perl-base. (Closes: Bug#96439)
  * Force LANG=C. Need to work out how i18n should be handled.
  * Kludge potato install so it's noninteractive. Thanks to Colin Watson
    for the patch. (Closes: Bug#94441)
  * Get rid of dh_testversion.
  * Make a sid script (just a symlink to the woody script).

debootstrap (0.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't worry if umounting /dev/pts fails.
  * Add debootstrap(8) manpage, thanks to Matt Kraai. (Closes: Bug#86238)
  * Add a blank line to the end of the faked /var/lib/dpkg/status. Spotted
    by Richard Hirst.
  * Added console-tools and console-data into the base system.
  * Move /etc/exim.conf to /etc/exim/exim.conf so that sendmail doesn't
    give errors, even if debconf tries to use it before exim is
    configured.  Gack.
  * Add fdutils back into base.

debootstrap (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only create stuff in /etc if it hasn't already been created.

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Mon, 23 Apr 2001 18:02:55 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use "head -n X" instead of "head -X" to work with busybox.
    (Closes: Bug#94575)
  * Use s///I instead of s///i for case insensitivity, again for busybox.
    (Closes: Bug#94579)
  * Fixed typo that would have stopped debootstrap from falling back to an
    uncompressed Packages file.
  * Added libsasl7 and libldap2 to woody base, since woody exim now depends
    on them.

debootstrap (0.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * If we've got a Release file, check that the Packages files we download
    have the right md5sums.
  * Build-Depend on new makedev, and don't hax0r powerpc devices as much.
    (Closes: Bug#93836)
  * Hopefully support arm chroots. (Closes: Bug#92592) Declare it to be
    Arch: any, and see what dies. There's a chance that nothing will. Not
    a *big* chance, but a chance.
  * Fiddled with the base system some more. Added apt-utils so
    preconfiguration will work.
  * Added permission to NMU to the README.Debian.
  * Mention file:/ URLs in README.Debian. (Closes: Bug#87099)
  * Add a --boot-floppies option that changes the way the I/O happens, in
    a way that's hopefully useful for boot-floppies. See README.Debian for
    details.
  * Also added a bit more output.

debootstrap (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Switch from debconf-tiny to debconf, since that's what's now in
    woody. (Using debconf-tiny probably makes the package unusable, hence
    the urgency) Fixup perl, lilo and console-apt to cope with changes in
    the base system in woody. Added ae, left nano and nvi.
  * Add support for m68k, sparc and powerpc, based on Christian Steigies
    patches and Adam Di Carlo's NMU (Closes: Bug#89883, Bug#91221)

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Sun, 25 Mar 2001 14:29:02 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for slink.
  * Fix support for woody (no lilo, console-*, different perl)
  * Re-download Packages files every time (Closes: Bug#88438)
    (Should this be changed to re-download things where the md5 doesn't match?)

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Sun,  4 Mar 2001 19:42:29 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. (Closes: Bug#82245)

  * Called it debootstrap instead of debchroot, because it's more about
    bootstrapping a Debian environment, whether that will end up being
    in a chroot, or as a standalone system. Blame Adam di Carlo. :)

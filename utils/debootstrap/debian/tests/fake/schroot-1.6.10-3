# fake/schroot-1.6.10-3 -- emulate how schroot/1.6.10-3 would chroot.
#
# Please do not modify this script without verifying that its behaviour
# is still equivalent to the stated versions of schroot. If a future
# version of schroot changes its behaviour, please copy this script and
# modify the copy instead.
#
# This version has #856877 unfixed. It bind-mounts /dev/pts and maybe
# /dev from the host system, rather than creating a new instance of /dev/pts.
# (There is of course a lot more that it does, but these are the parts that
# affect pty users like script(1).)

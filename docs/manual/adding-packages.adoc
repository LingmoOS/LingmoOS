== Adding new packages to Buildroot

This section covers how new packages (userspace libraries or
applications) can be integrated into Buildroot. It also shows how
existing packages are integrated, which is needed for fixing issues or
tuning their configuration.

When you add a new package, be sure to test it in various conditions
(see xref:testing-package[]) and also check it for coding style (see
xref:check-package[]).

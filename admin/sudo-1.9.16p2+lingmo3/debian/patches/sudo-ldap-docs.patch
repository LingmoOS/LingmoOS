 ## Build instructions
 
-The simplest way to build sudo with LDAP support is to include the
-`--with-ldap` option.
-
-    $ ./configure --with-ldap
-
-If your ldap libraries and headers are in a non-standard place, you will need
-to specify them at configure time.  E.g.
-
-    $ ./configure --with-ldap=/usr/local/ldapsdk
-
-Sudo is developed using OpenLDAP but Netscape-based LDAP libraries
-(such as those present in Solaris) and IBM LDAP are also known to work.
-
-If special configuration was required to build an LDAP-enabled sudo,
-let the sudo workers mailing list <sudo-workers@sudo.ws> know so
-we can improve sudo.
+The Debian package of sudo-ldap is already built with LDAP support
+using the OpenLDAP libs.

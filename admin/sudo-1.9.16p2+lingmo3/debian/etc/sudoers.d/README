#
# The default /etc/sudoers file created on installation of the
# sudo  package now includes the directive:
# 
# 	@includedir /etc/sudoers.d
# 
# This will cause sudo to read and parse any files in the /etc/sudoers.d 
# directory that do not end in '~' or contain a '.' character, if it
# exists. It is not an error if the directory does not exist.
# 
# Note also, that because sudoers contents can vary widely, no attempt is 
# made to add this directive to existing sudoers files on upgrade.  Feel free
# to add the above directive to the end of your /etc/sudoers file to enable 
# this functionality for existing installations if you wish!
# Sudo versions older than 1.9.1 will only support the old syntax
# #includedir. That means that the sudo versions in Debian bullseye (11)
# and later will happily accept both @includedir and #includedir.
#
# Finally, please note that using the visudo command is the recommended way
# to update sudoers content, since it protects against many failure modes.
# See the man page for visudo and sudoers for more information.

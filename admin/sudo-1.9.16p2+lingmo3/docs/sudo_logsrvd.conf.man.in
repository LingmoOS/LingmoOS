.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
\fBsudo_logsrvd.conf\fR
file is used to configure the
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
log server.
It uses an INI-style format made up of sections in square brackets and
\(lqkey = value\(rq
pairs specific to each section below the section name.
Depending on the key, values may be integers, booleans, or strings.
Section and key names are not case sensitive, but values are.
.PP
The pound sign
(\(oq#\(cq)
is used to indicate a comment.
Both the comment character and any text after it, up to the end of
the line, are ignored.
Lines beginning with a semi-colon
(\(oq\&;\(cq)
are also ignored.
.PP
Long lines can be continued with a backslash
(\(oq\e\(cq)
as the last character on the line.
Leading white space is removed from the beginning of lines
even when the continuation character is used.
.PP
The
\fIEXAMPLES\fR

Each section is described in detail below.
.SS "server"
The
\fIserver\fR
section configures the address and port the server will listen on.
The following keys are recognized:
.TP 6n
listen_address = host[:port][(tls)]
The host name or IP address, optional port to listen on and
an optional Transport Layer Security (TLS) flag in parentheses.
.sp
The host may be a host name, an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address
in square brackets or the wild card entry
\(oq*\(cq.
A host setting of
\(oq*\(cq
will cause
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
to listen on all configured network interfaces.
.sp
If the optional tls flag is present,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will secure the connection with TLS version 1.2 or 1.3.
Versions of TLS prior to 1.2 are not supported.
See
sudo_logsrvd(8)
for details on generating TLS keys and certificates.
.sp
If a port is specified, it may either be a port number or a known
service name as defined by the system service name database.
If no port is specified, port 30343 will be used for plaintext
connections and port 30344 will be used for TLS connections.
.sp
The default value is:
.nf
.RS 12n
listen_address = *:30343
listen_address = *:30344(tls)
.RE
.fi
.RS 6n
which will listen on all configured network interfaces for both
plaintext and TLS connections.
Multiple
\fIlisten_address\fR
lines may be specified to listen on more than one port or interface.
.RE
.TP 6n
server_log = string
Where to log server warning and error messages.
Supported values are
\fInone\fR,
\fIstderr\fR,
\fIsyslog\fR,
or a path name beginning with the
\(oq/\(cq
character.
A value of
\fIstderr\fR
is only effective when used in conjunction with the
\fB\-n\fR
option.
The default value is
\fIsyslog\fR.
.TP 6n
pid_file = path
The path to the file containing the process ID of the running
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR.
If set to an empty value, or if
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
is run with the
\fB\-n\fR
option, no
\fIpid_file\fR
will be created.
If
\fIpid_file\fR
refers to a symbolic link, it will be ignored.
The default value is
\fI@rundir@/sudo_logsrvd.pid\fR.
.TP 6n
tcp_keepalive = boolean
If true,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will enable the TCP keepalive socket option on the client connection.
This enables the periodic transmission of keepalive messages to the client.
If the client does not respond to a message in time, the connection will
be closed.
Defaults to
\fItrue\fR.
.TP 6n
timeout = number
The amount of time, in seconds,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will wait for the client to respond.
A value of 0 will disable the timeout.
The default value is
\fI30\fR.
.TP 6n
tls_cacert = path
The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM format,
to use instead of the system's default certificate authority database
when authenticating clients.

\fI/etc/ssl/sudo/cacert.pem\fR
if it exists, otherwise the system's default certificate authority
database is used.
.TP 6n
tls_cert = path
The path to the server's certificate file, in PEM format.
The default value is
\fI/etc/ssl/sudo/certs/logsrvd_cert.pem\fR.
.TP 6n
tls_checkpeer = bool
If true, client certificates will be validated by
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR;
clients without a valid certificate will be unable to connect.
If false, no validation of client certificates will be performed.
It true and client certificates are created using a private certificate
authority, the
\fItls_cacert\fR
setting must be set to a CA bundle that contains the CA certificate
used to generate the client certificate.
The default value is
\fIfalse\fR.
.TP 6n
tls_ciphers_v12 = string
A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS version 1.2 only,
separated by a colon
\(oq:\&\(cq.
See the
\fICIPHER LIST FORMAT\fR
section in
openssl-ciphers(1)
for full details.
The default value is
\(lqHIGH:!aNULL\(rq
which consists of encryption cipher suites with key lengths larger than
128 bits, and some cipher suites with 128-bit keys.
Cipher suites that offer no authentication are excluded.
.TP 6n
tls_ciphers_v13 = string
A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS version 1.3 only,
separated by a colon
\(oq:\&\(cq.
Supported cipher suites depend on the version of OpenSSL used,
but should include the following:
.sp
.RS 12n

.RE
.RS 6n
.sp
The default cipher suite is
\(lqTLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\(rq.
.RE
.PD
.TP 6n
tls_dhparams = path
The path to a file containing custom Diffie-Hellman parameters in PEM format.
This file can be created with the following command:
.nf
.sp
.RS 6n
openssl dhparam -out /etc/sudo_logsrvd_dhparams.pem 2048
.RE
.fi
.RS 6n
.sp
By default,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will use the OpenSSL defaults for Diffie-Hellman key generation.
.RE
.TP 6n
tls_key = path
The path to the server's private key file, in PEM format.
The default value is
\fI/etc/ssl/sudo/private/logsrvd_key.pem\fR.
.TP 6n
tls_verify = bool
If true,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will validate its own certificate at startup time or when the
configuration is changed.
If false, no verification is performed of the server certificate.
When using self-signed certificates without a certificate authority,
this setting should be set to false.
The default value is
\fItrue\fR.
.SS "relay"
The
\fIrelay\fR
section configures the optional logsrv relay host and port the server will
connect to.
The TLS configuration keys are optional, by default the corresponding
keys in the
\fIserver\fR
section will be used.
They are only present in this section to make it possible for the relay
connection to use a different set of TLS parameters from the client-facing
server.
The following keys are recognized:
.TP 6n
connect_timeout = number
The amount of time, in seconds,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will wait for the connection to a
\fIrelay_host\fR
(see below) to complete.
Once the connection is complete, the
\fItimeout\fR
setting controls the amount of time
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will wait for the relay to respond.
A value of 0 will disable the timeout.
The default value is
\fI30\fR.
.TP 6n
relay_dir = path
The directory in which log messages are temporarily stored before they
are sent to the relay host.
Messages are stored in the wire format specified by
sudo_logsrv.proto(@mansectform@)
The default value is
\fI@relay_dir@\fR.
.TP 6n
relay_host = host[:port][(tls)]
The relay host name or IP address, optional port to connect to and
an optional Transport Layer Security (TLS) flag in parentheses.
The syntax is identical to
\fIlisten_address\fR
in the
\fIserver\fR
section with one exception: the wild card
\(oq*\(cq
syntax is not supported.
.sp
When this setting is enabled, messages from the client will be forwarded
to one of the specified relay hosts instead of being stored locally.
The
\fIhost\fR
could be running an instance of
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
or another server that supports the
sudo_logsrv.proto(@mansectform@)
protocol.
.sp
If multiple
\fIrelay_host\fR
lines are specified, the first available relay host will be used.
.TP 6n
retry_interval = number
The number of seconds to wait after a connection error before making
a new attempt to forward a message to a relay host.
The default value is
\fI30\fR.
.TP 6n
store_first = boolean
If true,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will store logs locally before relaying them.
Once the log is complete, a connection to the relay host is opened
and the log is relayed.
If the network connection is interrupted before the log can be fully
transferred, it will be retransmitted later.
The default is to relay logs in real-time.
.TP 6n
tcp_keepalive = boolean
If true,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will enable the TCP keepalive socket option on the relay connection.
This enables the periodic transmission of keepalive messages to the relay
server.
If the relay does not respond to a message in time, the connection will
be closed.
.TP 6n
timeout = number
The amount of time, in seconds,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will wait for the relay server to respond after a connection has succeeded.
A value of 0 will disable the timeout.
The default value is
\fI30\fR.
.TP 6n
tls_cacert = path
The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM format,
to use instead of the system's default certificate authority database
when authenticating clients.
The default is to use the value specified in the
\fIserver\fR
section, or the system's default certificate authority database if
no value is set.
.TP 6n
tls_cert = path
The path to the server's certificate file, in PEM format.
The default is to use the value specified in the
\fIserver\fR
section.
.TP 6n
tls_checkpeer = bool
If true, the relay host's certificate will be validated by
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR;
connections to a relay without a valid certificate will fail.
If false, no validation of relay certificates will be performed.
It true and relay certificates are created using a private certificate
authority, the
\fItls_cacert\fR
setting must be set to a CA bundle that contains the CA certificate
used to generate the relay certificate.
The default is to use the value specified in the
\fIserver\fR
section.
.TP 6n
tls_ciphers_v12 = string
A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS version 1.2 only,
separated by a colon
\(oq:\&\(cq.
See the
\fICIPHER LIST FORMAT\fR
section in
openssl-ciphers(1)
for full details.
The default is to use the value specified in the
\fIserver\fR
section.
.TP 6n
tls_ciphers_v13 = string
A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS version 1.3 only,
separated by a colon
\(oq:\&\(cq.
Supported cipher suites depend on the version of OpenSSL used,
see the
\fIserver\fR
section for more information.
The default is to use the value specified in the
\fIserver\fR
section.
.TP 6n
tls_dhparams = path
The path to a file containing custom Diffie-Hellman parameters in PEM format.
The default is to use the value specified in the
\fIserver\fR
section.
.TP 6n
tls_key = path
The path to the server's private key file, in PEM format.
The default is to use the value specified in the
\fIserver\fR
section.
.TP 6n
tls_verify = bool
If true, the server's certificate used for relaying will be verified at startup.
If false, no verification is performed of the server certificate.
When using self-signed certificates without a certificate authority,
this setting should be set to false.
The default is to use the value specified in the
\fIserver\fR
section.
.SS "iolog"
The
\fIiolog\fR
section configures I/O log parameters.
These settings are identical to the I/O configuration in
sudoers(@mansectform@).
The following keys are recognized:
.TP 6n
iolog_compress = boolean
If set, I/O logs will be compressed using
\fBzlib\fR.
Enabling compression can make it harder to view the logs in real-time as
the program is executing due to buffering.
The default value is
\fIfalse\fR.
.TP 6n
iolog_dir = path
The top-level directory to use when constructing the path
name for the I/O log directory.
The session sequence number, if any, is stored in the directory.
The default value is
\fI@iolog_dir@\fR.
.sp
The following percent
(\(oq%\(cq)
escape sequences are supported:
.PP
.RS 6n
.PD 0
.TP 6n
%{seq}
expanded to a monotonically increasing base-36 sequence number, such as 0100A5,
where every two digits are used to form a new directory, e.g.,
\fI01/00/A5\fR
.PD
.TP 6n
%{user}
expanded to the invoking user's login name
.TP 6n
%{group}
expanded to the name of the invoking user's real group-ID
.TP 6n
%{runas_user}
expanded to the login name of the user the command will
be run as (e.g., root)
.TP 6n
%{runas_group}
expanded to the group name of the user the command will
be run as (e.g., wheel)
.TP 6n
%{hostname}
expanded to the local host name without the domain name
.TP 6n
%{command}
expanded to the base name of the command being run
.PP
In addition, any escape sequences supported by the system's
strftime(3)
function will be expanded.
.sp
To include a literal
\(oq%\(cq
character, the string
\(oq%%\(cq
should be used.
.RE
.TP 6n
iolog_file = path
The path name, relative to
\fIiolog_dir\fR,
in which to store I/O logs.
It is possible for
\fIiolog_file\fR
to contain directory components.
The default value is
\(lq%{seq}\(rq.
.sp
See the
\fIiolog_dir\fR
setting above for a list of supported percent
(\(oq%\(cq)
escape sequences.
.sp
In addition to the escape sequences, path names that end in six or
more
\fIX\fRs
will have the
\fIX\fRs
replaced with a unique combination of digits and letters, similar to the
mktemp(3)
function.
.sp
If the path created by concatenating
\fIiolog_dir\fR
and
\fIiolog_file\fR
already exists, the existing I/O log file will be truncated and
overwritten unless
\fIiolog_file\fR
ends in six or
more
\fIX\fRs.
.TP 6n
iolog_flush = boolean
If set, I/O log data is flushed to disk after each write instead of
buffering it.
This makes it possible to view the logs in real-time as the program is
executing but may significantly reduce the effectiveness
of I/O log compression.
I/O logs are always flushed before sending a commit point to the client
regardless of this setting.
The default value is
\fItrue\fR.
.TP 6n
iolog_group = name
The group name to look up when setting the group-ID on new I/O log
files and directories.
If
\fIiolog_group\fR
is not set,
the primary group-ID of the user specified by
\fIiolog_user is used.\fR
If neither
\fIiolog_group\fR
nor
\fIiolog_user\fR
are set, I/O log files and directories are created with group-ID 0.
.TP 6n
iolog_mode = mode
The file mode to use when creating I/O log files.
Mode bits for read and write permissions for owner, group, or other
are honored, everything else is ignored.
The file permissions will always include the owner read and
write bits, even if they are not present in the specified mode.
When creating I/O log directories, search (execute) bits are added
to match the read and write bits specified by
\fIiolog_mode\fR.
The default value is
\fI0600\fR.
.TP 6n
iolog_user = name
The user name to look up when setting the owner of new
I/O log files and directories.
If
\fIiolog_group\fR
is set, it will be used instead of the user's primary group-ID.
By default, I/O log files and directories are created with user and
group-ID 0.
.TP 6n
log_passwords = bool
Most programs that require a user's password will disable echo before
reading the password to avoid displaying the plaintext password on
the screen.
However, if terminal input is being logged,
the password will still be present in the I/O log.
If
\fIlog_passwords\fR
is set to
\fIfalse\fR,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will attempt to prevent passwords from being logged.
It does this by using the regular expressions in
\fIpassprompt_regex\fR
to match a password prompt in the terminal output buffer.
When a match is found, input characters in the I/O log will be replaced with
\(oq*\(cq
until either a line feed or carriage return is found in the terminal input
or a new terminal output buffer is received.
If, however, a program displays characters as the user types them
(such as
\fBsudo\fR
when the
\fIpwfeedback\fR
option is set), only the
first character of the password will be replaced in the I/O log.
The default value is
\fItrue\fR.
.TP 6n
maxseq = number
The maximum sequence number that will be substituted for the
\(lq%{seq}\(rq
escape in the I/O log file (see the
\fIiolog_dir\fR
description above for more information).
While the value substituted for
\(lq%{seq}\(rq
is in base 36,
\fImaxseq\fR
itself should be expressed in decimal.
Values larger than 2176782336 (which corresponds to the
base 36 sequence number
\(lqZZZZZZ\(rq)
will be silently truncated to 2176782336.
The default value is
\fI2176782336\fR.
.TP 6n
passprompt_regex = string
One or more POSIX extended regular expressions used to
match password prompts in the terminal output when
\fIlog_passwords\fR
is disabled.
As an extension, if the regular expression begins with
\(lq(?i)\(rq,
it will be matched in a case-insensitive manner.
Multiple
\fIpassprompt_regex\fR
settings may be specified.
Each regular expression is limited to 1024 characters.
The default value is
\(lq[Pp]assword[: ]*\(rq.
.SS "eventlog"
The
\fIeventlog\fR
section configures how (and if) security policy events are logged.
.TP 6n
log_type = string
Where to log accept, reject, and alert events reported by the policy.
Supported values are
\fIsyslog\fR,
\fIlogfile\fR,
and
\fInone\fR.
The default value is
\fIsyslog\fR.
.TP 6n
log_exit = boolean
If true,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will log an event when a command exits or is terminated by a signal.
Defaults to
\fIfalse\fR.
.TP 6n
log_format = string
The event log format.
Supported log formats are:
.PP
.RS 6n
.PD 0
.TP 6n
json
Currently, this is an alias for
\fIjson_pretty\fR.
In a future version of
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR,
\fIjson\fR
will be equivalent to
\fIjson_compact\fR.
JSON log entries contain the full contents of the accept, reject, exit
and alert messages.
.PD
.TP 6n
json_compact
Log events in
\(lqcompact\(rq
(minified) JSON format.
Each event is written as a separate JSON object on single line without
extraneous white space.
Due to limitations of the protocol, JSON events sent via
\fIsyslog\fR
may be truncated.
.TP 6n
json_pretty
Log events in
\(lqpretty\(rq
JSON format.
When logging to a file, the entire file is treated as a single JSON
object consisting of multiple events, each event spanning multiple lines.
When logging via
\fIsyslog\fR,
there is no difference between the
\fIjson_pretty\fR
and
\fIjson_compact\fR
formats.
.TP 6n
sudo
Log events in traditional sudo-style log format.
See the
\fIEVENT LOGGING\fR
section in
sudoers(@mansectform@)
for details.
.PP
The default value is
\fIsudo\fR.
.RE
.SS "syslog"
The
\fIsyslog\fR
section configures how events are logged via
syslog(3).
.TP 6n
facility = string
Syslog facility if syslog is being used for logging.
Defaults to
\fI@logfac@\fR.
.sp
The following syslog facilities are supported:
\fBauthpriv\fR
(if your
OS supports it),
\fBauth\fR,
\fBdaemon\fR,
\fBuser\fR,
\fBlocal0\fR,
\fBlocal1\fR,
\fBlocal2\fR,
\fBlocal3\fR,
\fBlocal4\fR,
\fBlocal5\fR,
\fBlocal6\fR,
and
\fBlocal7\fR.
.TP 6n
accept_priority = string
Syslog priority to use when the user is allowed to run a command and
authentication is successful.
Defaults to
\fI@goodpri@\fR.
.sp
The following syslog priorities are supported:
\fBalert\fR,
\fBcrit\fR,
\fBdebug\fR,
\fBemerg\fR,
\fBerr\fR,
\fBinfo\fR,
\fBnotice\fR,
\fBwarning\fR,
and
\fBnone\fR.
Setting it to a value of
\fBnone\fR
will disable logging of successful commands.
.TP 6n
reject_priority = string
Syslog priority to use when the user is not allowed to run a command or
when authentication is unsuccessful.
Defaults to
\fI@badpri@\fR.
.sp
See
\fIaccept_priority\fR
for the list of supported syslog priorities.
.TP 6n
alert_priority = string
Syslog priority to use for event log alert messages received from the client.
Defaults to
\fI@badpri@\fR.
.sp
See
\fIaccept_priority\fR
for the list of supported syslog priorities.
.TP 6n
maxlen = number
On many systems,
syslog(3)
has a relatively small log buffer.
IETF RFC 5424 states that syslog servers must support messages of
at least 480 bytes and should support messages up to 2048 bytes.
By default,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
creates log messages up to 960 bytes which corresponds to the
historic
BSD
syslog implementation which used a 1024 byte buffer
to store the message, date, hostname, and program name.
.sp
To prevent syslog messages from being truncated,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will split up sudo-style log messages that are larger than
\fImaxlen\fR
bytes.
When a message is split, additional parts will include the string
\(lq(command continued)\(rq
after the user name and before the continued command line arguments.
JSON-format log entries are never split and are not affected by
\fImaxlen\fR.
.TP 6n
server_facility = string
Syslog facility if syslog is being used for server warning messages.
See above for a list of supported facilities.
Defaults to
\fIdaemon\fR
.SS "logfile"
The
\fIlogfile\fR
section consists of settings related to logging to a plain file
(not syslog).
.TP 6n
path = string
The path to the file-based event log.
This path must be fully-qualified and start with a
\(oq/\(cq
character.
The default value is
\fI@logpath@\fR.
.TP 6n
time_format = string
The string used when formatting the date and time for file-based event logs.
Formatting is performed via the system's
strftime(3)
function so any escape sequences supported by that function will be expanded.
The default value is
\(lq%h %e %T\(rq
which produces dates like
\(lqOct 3 07:15:24\(rq
in the
\(oqC\(cq
locale.

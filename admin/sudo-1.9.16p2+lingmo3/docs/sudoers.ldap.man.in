.SH "NAME"
\fBsudoers.ldap\fR
\- sudo LDAP configuration
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
In addition to the standard
\fIsudoers\fR
file,
\fBsudo\fR
may be configured
via LDAP.
This can be especially useful for synchronizing
\fIsudoers\fR
in a large, distributed environment.
.PP
Using LDAP for
\fIsudoers\fR
has several benefits:
.TP 3n
\fB\(bu\fR
\fBsudo\fR
no longer needs to read
\fIsudoers\fR
in its entirety.
When LDAP is used, there are only two or three LDAP queries per invocation.
This makes it especially fast and particularly usable in LDAP environments.
.TP 3n
\fB\(bu\fR
It is possible to specify per-entry options that override the global
default options.
\fI@sysconfdir@/sudoers\fR
only supports default options and limited options associated with
user/host/commands/aliases.
The syntax is complicated and can be difficult for users to understand.
Placing the options directly in the entry is more natural.
.TP 3n
\fB\(bu\fR
The
\fBvisudo\fR
program is no longer needed.
\fBvisudo\fR
provides locking and syntax checking of the
\fI@sysconfdir@/sudoers\fR
file.
Since LDAP updates are atomic, locking is no longer necessary.
Because syntax is checked when the data is inserted into LDAP, there
is no need for a specialized tool to check syntax.
.SS "SUDOers LDAP container"
The
\fIsudoers\fR
configuration is contained in the
\(oqou=SUDOers\(cq
LDAP container.
.PP
Sudo first looks for the
\(oqcn=defaults\(cq
entry in the SUDOers container.
If found, the multi-valued
\fIsudoOption\fR
attribute is parsed in the same manner as a global
\fIDefaults\fR
line in
\fI@sysconfdir@/sudoers\fR.
In the following example, the
\fRSSH_AUTH_SOCK\fR
variable will be preserved in the environment for all users.

.PP
The equivalent of a sudoer in LDAP is a
\fIsudoRole\fR.
It consists of the following attributes:
.TP 6n
\fBsudoUser\fR
A user name, user-ID (prefixed with
\(oq#\(cq),
Unix group name or ID (prefixed with
\(oq%\(cq
or
\(oq%#\(cq
respectively), user netgroup (prefixed with
\(oq+\(cq),
or non-Unix group name or ID (prefixed with
\(oq%:\(cq
or
\(oq%:#\(cq
respectively).
User netgroups are matched using the user and domain members only;
the host member is not used when matching.
Non-Unix group support is only available when an appropriate
\fIgroup_plugin\fR
is defined in the global
\fIdefaults\fR
\fIsudoRole\fR
object.
If a
\fIsudoUser\fR
entry is preceded by an exclamation point,
\(oq\&!\(cq,
and the entry matches, the
\fIsudoRole\fR
in which it resides will be ignored.
Negated
\fIsudoUser\fR
entries are only supported by version 1.9.9 or higher.
.TP 6n
\fBsudoHost\fR
A host name, IP address, IP network, or host netgroup (prefixed with a
\(oq+\(cq).
The special value
\fBALL\fR
will match any host.
Host netgroups are matched using the host (both qualified and unqualified)
and domain members only; the user member is not used when matching.
If a
\fIsudoHost\fR
entry is preceded by an exclamation point,
\(oq\&!\(cq,
and the entry matches, the
\fIsudoRole\fR
in which it resides will be ignored.
Negated
\fIsudoHost\fR
entries are only supported by version 1.8.18 or higher.
.TP 6n
\fBsudoCommand\fR
A fully-qualified Unix command name with optional command line arguments,
potentially including globbing characters (aka wild cards).
If a command name is preceded by an exclamation point,
\(oq\&!\(cq,
the user will be prohibited from running that command.
.sp
The built-in command
\(lqsudoedit\(rq
is used to permit a user to run
\fBsudo\fR
with the
\fB\-e\fR
option (or as
\fBsudoedit\fR).
It may take command line arguments just as a normal command does.
Unlike other commands,
\(lqsudoedit\(rq
is a built into
\fBsudo\fR
itself and must be specified in without a leading path.
.sp
The special value
\fBALL\fR
will match any command.
.sp
If a command name is prefixed with a SHA-2 digest, it will
only be allowed if the digest matches.
This may be useful in situations where the user invoking
\fBsudo\fR
has write access to the command or its parent directory.
The following digest formats are supported: sha224, sha256, sha384, and sha512.
The digest name must be followed by a colon
(\(oq:\&\(cq)
and then the actual digest, in either hex or base64 format.
For example, given the following value for sudoCommand:
.nf
.sp
.RS 10n
sha224:0GomF8mNN3wlDt1HD9XldjJ3SNgpFdbjO1+NsQ /bin/ls
.RE
.fi
.RS 6n
.sp
The user may only run
\fI/bin/ls\fR
if its sha224 digest matches the specified value.
Command digests are only supported by version 1.8.7 or higher.
.RE
.TP 6n
\fBsudoOption\fR
Identical in function to the global options described above, but
specific to the
\fIsudoRole\fR
in which it resides.
.TP 6n
\fBsudoRunAsUser\fR
A user name or user-ID (prefixed with
\(oq#\(cq)
that commands may be run as or a Unix group (prefixed with a
\(oq%\(cq)
or user netgroup (prefixed with a
\(oq+\(cq)
that contains a list of users that commands may be run as.
The special value
\fBALL\fR
will match any user.
If a
\fIsudoRunAsUser\fR
entry is preceded by an exclamation point,
\(oq\&!\(cq,
and the entry matches, the
\fIsudoRole\fR
in which it resides will be ignored.
If
\fIsudoRunAsUser\fR
is specified but empty, it will match the invoking user.
If neither
\fIsudoRunAsUser\fR
nor
\fIsudoRunAsGroup\fR
are present, the value of the
\fIrunas_default\fR
\fIsudoOption\fR
is used (defaults to @runas_default@).
.sp
The
\fIsudoRunAsUser\fR
attribute is only available in
\fBsudo\fR
versions
1.7.0 and higher.
Older versions of
\fBsudo\fR
use the
\fIsudoRunAs\fR
attribute instead.
Negated
\fIsudoRunAsUser\fR
entries are only supported by version 1.8.26 or higher.
.TP 6n
\fBsudoRunAsGroup\fR
A Unix group or group-ID (prefixed with
\(oq#\(cq)
that commands may be run as.
The special value
\fBALL\fR
will match any group.
If a
\fIsudoRunAsGroup\fR
entry is preceded by an exclamation point,
\(oq\&!\(cq,
and the entry matches, the
\fIsudoRole\fR
in which it resides will be ignored.
.sp
The
\fIsudoRunAsGroup\fR
attribute is only available in
\fBsudo\fR
versions
1.7.0 and higher.
Negated
\fIsudoRunAsGroup\fR
entries are only supported by version 1.8.26 or higher.
.TP 6n
\fBsudoNotBefore\fR
A timestamp in the form
\(oqyyyymmddHHMMSSZ\(cq
that can be used to provide a start date/time for when the
\fIsudoRole\fR
will be valid.
If multiple
\fIsudoNotBefore\fR
entries are present, the earliest is used.
Timestamps must be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
not the local timezone.
The minute and seconds portions are optional, but some LDAP servers
require that they be present (contrary to the RFC).
.sp
The
\fIsudoNotBefore\fR
attribute is only available in
\fBsudo\fR
versions 1.7.5 and higher and must be explicitly enabled via the
\fBSUDOERS_TIMED\fR
option in
\fI@ldap_conf@\fR.
.TP 6n
\fBsudoNotAfter\fR
A timestamp in the form
\(oqyyyymmddHHMMSSZ\(cq
that indicates an expiration date/time, after which the
\fIsudoRole\fR
will no longer be valid.
If multiple
\fIsudoNotAfter\fR
entries are present, the last one is used.
Timestamps must be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
not the local timezone.
The minute and seconds portions are optional, but some LDAP servers
require that they be present (contrary to the RFC).
.sp
The
\fIsudoNotAfter\fR
attribute is only available in
\fBsudo\fR
versions
1.7.5 and higher and must be explicitly enabled via the
\fBSUDOERS_TIMED\fR
option in
\fI@ldap_conf@\fR.
.TP 6n
\fBsudoOrder\fR
The
\fIsudoRole\fR
entries retrieved from the LDAP directory have no inherent order.
The
\fIsudoOrder\fR
attribute is an integer (or floating point value for LDAP servers
that support it) that is used to sort the matching entries.
This allows LDAP-based sudoers entries to more closely mimic the behavior
of the sudoers file, where the order of the entries influences the result.
If multiple entries match, the entry with the highest
\fIsudoOrder\fR
attribute is chosen.
This corresponds to the
\(lqlast match\(rq
behavior of the sudoers file.
If the
\fIsudoOrder\fR
attribute is not present, a value of 0 is assumed.
.sp
The
\fIsudoOrder\fR
attribute is only available in
\fBsudo\fR
versions 1.7.5 and higher.
.PP
Each attribute listed above should contain a single value, but there
may be multiple instances of each attribute type.
A
\fIsudoRole\fR
must contain at least one
\fIsudoUser\fR,
\fIsudoHost\fR,
and
\fIsudoCommand\fR.
.PP
The following example allows users in group wheel to run any command
on any host via
\fBsudo\fR:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
dn: cn=%wheel,ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: sudoRole
cn: %wheel
sudoUser: %wheel
sudoHost: ALL
sudoCommand: ALL
.RE
.fi
.SS "Anatomy of LDAP sudoers lookup"
When looking up a sudoer using LDAP there are only two or three
LDAP queries per invocation.
The first query is to parse the global options.
The second is to match against the user's name and the groups that
the user belongs to.
(The special
\fBALL\fR
tag is matched in this query too.)
If no match is returned for the user's name and groups, a third
query returns all entries containing user netgroups and other
non-Unix groups and checks to see if the user belongs to any of them.
.PP
If timed entries are enabled with the
\fBSUDOERS_TIMED\fR
parameter, the LDAP queries include a sub-filter that limits retrieval
to entries that satisfy the time constraints, if any.
.PP
If the
\fBNETGROUP_BASE\fR
parameter is present and
\fBNETGROUP_QUERY\fR
has not been disabled (see
\fIConfiguring ldap.conf\fR
below), queries are performed to determine the list of netgroups
the user belongs to before the sudoers query.
This makes it possible to include netgroups in the sudoers query
string in the same manner as Unix groups.
The third query mentioned above is not performed unless a group provider
plugin is also configured.
The actual LDAP queries performed by
\fBsudo\fR
are as follows:
.TP 5n
1.\&
Match all
\fInisNetgroup\fR
records with a
\fInisNetgroupTriple\fR
containing the user, host, and NIS domain.
The query will match
\fInisNetgroupTriple\fR
entries with either the short or long form of the host name or
no host name specified in the tuple.
If the NIS domain is set, the query will match only match entries
that include the domain or for which there is no domain present.
If the NIS domain is
\fInot\fR
set, a wildcard is used to match any domain name but be aware that the
NIS schema used by some LDAP servers may not support wild cards for
\fInisNetgroupTriple\fR.
.TP 5n
2.\&
Repeated queries are performed to find any nested
\fInisNetgroup\fR
records with a
\fImemberNisNetgroup\fR
entry that refers to an already-matched record.
.PP
For sites with a large number of netgroups, using
\fBNETGROUP_BASE\fR
can significantly speed up
\fBsudo\fR's
execution time as long as the LDAP server supports querying the
\fInisNetgroup\fR
object by its
\fInisNetgroupTriple\fR
attribute.
.SS "Differences between LDAP and non-LDAP sudoers"
One of the major differences between LDAP and file-based
\fIsudoers\fR
is that in LDAP,
\fBsudo\fR-specific
Aliases are not supported.
.PP
For the most part, there is little need for
\fBsudo\fR-specific
Aliases.
Unix groups, non-Unix groups (via the
\fIgroup_plugin\fR),
or user netgroups can be used in place of User_Aliases and Runas_Aliases.
Host netgroups can be used in place of Host_Aliases.
Since groups and netgroups can also be stored in LDAP there is no real need for
\fBsudo\fR-specific
aliases.
.PP
There are also some subtle differences in the way sudoers is handled
once in LDAP.
Probably the biggest is that according to the RFC, LDAP ordering
is arbitrary and you cannot expect that Attributes and Entries are
returned in any specific order.
.PP
The order in which different entries are applied can be controlled
using the
\fIsudoOrder\fR
attribute, but there is no way to guarantee the order of attributes
within a specific entry.
If there are conflicting command rules in an entry, the negative
takes precedence.
This is called paranoid behavior (not necessarily the most specific
match).
.PP
Here is an example:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
# /etc/sudoers:
# Allow all commands except shell
johnny  ALL=(root) ALL,!/bin/sh
# Always allows all commands because ALL is matched last
puddles ALL=(root) !/bin/sh,ALL

# LDAP equivalent of johnny
# Allows all commands except shell
dn: cn=role1,ou=Sudoers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
objectClass: sudoRole
objectClass: top
cn: role1
sudoUser: johnny
sudoHost: ALL
sudoCommand: ALL
sudoCommand: !/bin/sh

# LDAP equivalent of puddles
# Notice that even though ALL comes last, it still behaves like
# role1 since the LDAP code assumes the more paranoid configuration
dn: cn=role2,ou=Sudoers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
objectClass: sudoRole
objectClass: top
cn: role2
sudoUser: puddles
sudoHost: ALL
sudoCommand: !/bin/sh
sudoCommand: ALL
.RE
.fi
.SS "Converting between file-based and LDAP sudoers"
The
cvtsudoers(1)
utility can be used to convert between file-based and LDAP
\fIsudoers\fR.
However, there are features in the file-based sudoers that have
no equivalent in LDAP-based sudoers (and vice versa).
These cannot be converted automatically.
.PP
For example, a Cmnd_Alias in a
\fIsudoers\fR
file may be converted to a
\fIsudoRole\fR
that contains multiple commands.
Multiple users and/or groups may be assigned to the
\fIsudoRole\fR.
.PP
Also, host, user, runas, and command-based
\fIDefaults\fR
entries are not supported.
However, a
\fIsudoRole\fR
may contain one or more
\fIsudoOption\fR
attributes which can often serve the same purpose.
.PP
Consider the following
\fIsudoers\fR
lines:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
Cmnd_Alias PAGERS = /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/pg, /usr/bin/less
Defaults!PAGERS noexec
alice, bob ALL = ALL
.RE
.fi
.PP
In this example, alice and bob are allowed to run all commands, but
the commands listed in PAGERS will have the noexec flag set,
preventing shell escapes.
.PP
When converting this to LDAP, two sudoRole objects can be used:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
dn: cn=PAGERS,ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: sudoRole
cn: PAGERS
sudoUser: alice
sudoUser: bob
sudoHost: ALL
sudoCommand: /usr/bin/more
sudoCommand: /usr/bin/pg
sudoCommand: /usr/bin/less
sudoOption: noexec
sudoOrder: 900

dn: cn=ADMINS,ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: sudoRole
cn: ADMINS
sudoUser: alice
sudoUser: bob
sudoHost: ALL
sudoCommand: ALL
sudoOrder: 100
.RE
.fi
.PP
In the LDAP version, the sudoOrder attribute is used to guarantee
that the PAGERS sudoRole with
\fInoexec\fR
has precedence.
Unlike the
\fIsudoers\fR
version, the LDAP version requires that all users for whom the restriction
should apply be assigned to the PAGERS sudoRole.
Using a Unix group or netgroup in PAGERS rather than listing each
user would make this easier to maintain.
.PP
Per-user
\fIDefaults\fR
entries can be emulated by using one or more sudoOption attributes
in a sudoRole.
Consider the following
\fIsudoers\fR
lines:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
User_Alias ADMINS = john, sally
Defaults:ADMINS !authenticate
ADMINS ALL = (ALL:ALL) ALL
.RE
.fi
.PP
In this example, john and sally are allowed to run any command
as any user or group.
.PP
When converting this to LDAP, we can use a Unix group instead
of the User_Alias.
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
dn: cn=admins,ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: sudoRole
cn: admins
sudoUser: %admin
sudoHost: ALL
sudoRunAsUser: ALL
sudoRunAsGroup: ALL
sudoCommand: ALL
sudoOption: !authenticate
.RE
.fi
.PP
This assumes that users john and sally are members of the
\(lqadmins\(rq
Unix group.
.SS "Sudoers schema"
In order to use
\fBsudo\fR's
LDAP support, the
\fBsudo\fR
schema must be
installed on your LDAP server.
In addition, be sure to index the
\fIsudoUser\fR
attribute.
.PP
The
\fBsudo\fR
distribution includes versions of the
\fBsudoers\fR
schema for multiple LDAP servers:
.TP 6n
\fIschema.ActiveDirectory\fR
Microsoft Active Directory
.TP 6n
\fIschema.IBM_LDAP\fR
IBM Directory Server, also known as IBM Tivoli Directory Server,
IBM Security Directory Server, and IBM Security Verify Directory
.TP 6n
\fIschema.iPlanet\fR
Netscape-derived servers such as the iPlanet, Oracle,
and 389 Directory Servers
.TP 6n
\fIschema.olcSudo\fR
OpenLDAP slapd 2.3 and higher when on-line configuration is enabled
.TP 6n
\fIschema.OpenLDAP\fR
OpenLDAP slapd and
OpenBSD
ldapd
.PP
The schema in OpenLDAP format is also included in the
\fIEXAMPLES\fR
section.
.SS "Configuring ldap.conf"
Sudo reads the
\fI@ldap_conf@\fR
file for LDAP-specific configuration.
Typically, this file is shared between different LDAP-aware clients.
As such, most of the settings are not
\fBsudo\fR-specific.
The
\fI@ldap_conf@\fR
file is parsed by
\fBsudo\fR
itself and may support options that differ from those described in the
system's
ldap.conf(@mansectform@)
manual.
The path to
\fIldap.conf\fR
may be overridden via the
\fIldap_conf\fR
plugin argument in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@).
.PP
On systems using the OpenLDAP libraries, default values specified in
\fI/etc/openldap/ldap.conf\fR
or the user's
\fI.ldaprc\fR
files are not used.
.PP
\fBsudo\fR
supports a variety of LDAP library implementations, including
OpenLDAP, Netscape-derived (also used by Solaris and HP-UX), and
IBM LDAP (aka Tivoli).
Some options are specific to certain LDAP implementations or have
implementation-specific behavior.
These differences are noted below where applicable.
.PP
Only those options explicitly listed in
\fI@ldap_conf@\fR
as being supported by
\fBsudo\fR
are honored.
Configuration options are listed below in upper case but are parsed
in a case-independent manner.
.PP
Lines beginning with a pound sign
(\(oq#\(cq)
are ignored.
Leading white space is removed from the beginning of lines.
.TP 6n
\fBBIND_TIMELIMIT\fR \fIseconds\fR
The
\fBBIND_TIMELIMIT\fR
parameter specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait while trying
to connect to an LDAP server.
If multiple
\fBURI\fRs
or
\fBHOST\fRs
are specified, this is the amount of time to wait before trying
the next one in the list.
.TP 6n
\fBBINDDN\fR \fIDN\fR
The
\fBBINDDN\fR
parameter specifies the identity, in the form of a Distinguished Name (DN),
to use when performing LDAP operations.
If not specified, LDAP operations are performed with an anonymous identity.
By default, most LDAP servers will allow anonymous access.
.TP 6n
\fBBINDPW\fR \fIsecret\fR
The
\fBBINDPW\fR
parameter specifies the password to use when performing LDAP operations.
This is typically used in conjunction with the
\fBBINDDN\fR
parameter.
The
\fIsecret\fR
may be a plaintext password or a base64-encoded string with a
\(lqbase64:\(rq
prefix.
For example:
.nf
.sp
.RS 10n
BINDPW base64:dGVzdA==
.RE
.fi
.RS 6n
.sp
If a plaintext password is used, it should be a simple string without quotes.
Plain text passwords may not include the comment character
(\(oq#\(cq)
and the escaping of special characters with a backslash
(\(oq\e\(cq)
is not supported.
.RE
.TP 6n
\fBDEREF\fR \fInever/searching/finding/always\fR
How alias dereferencing is to be performed when searching.
See the
ldap.conf(@mansectform@)
manual for a full description of this option.
.TP 6n
\fBHOST\fR \fIname[:port] ...\fR
If no
\fBURI\fR
is specified (see below), the
\fBHOST\fR
parameter specifies a white space-delimited list of LDAP servers to connect to.
Each host may include an optional
\fIport\fR
separated by a colon
(\(oq:\&\(cq).
The
\fBHOST\fR
parameter is deprecated in favor of the
\fBURI\fR
specification and is included for backward compatibility only.
.TP 6n
\fBKRB5_CCNAME\fR \fIfile name\fR
The path to the Kerberos 5 credential cache to use when authenticating
with the remote server.
.sp
This option is only relevant when using SASL authentication (see below).
.TP 6n
\fBLDAP_VERSION\fR \fInumber\fR
The version of the LDAP protocol to use when connecting to the server.
The default value is protocol version 3.
.TP 6n
\fBNETGROUP_BASE\fR \fIbase\fR
The base DN to use when performing LDAP netgroup queries.
Typically this is of the form
\(oqou=netgroup,dc=my-domain,dc=com\(cq
for the domain my-domain.com.
Multiple
\fBNETGROUP_BASE\fR
lines may be specified, in which case they are queried in the order specified.
.sp
When this option is enabled,
\fBsudo\fR
will query the LDAP server directly when matching netgroups present in a
\fIsudoRole\fR
instead of relying on the C library's
\fBinnetgr\fR()
function.
.sp
Additionally, if the
\fBNETGROUP_QUERY\fR
parameter (which is enabled by default) has not been disabled, the
user's netgroups will be queried directly via LDAP for use in the
main sudoers query.
This is usually faster than fetching every
\fIsudoRole\fR
object containing a
\fIsudoUser\fR
that begins with a
\(oq+\(cq
prefix and checking whether the user is a member of each one.
The NIS schema used by some LDAP servers needs a modification to
support querying the
\fInisNetgroup\fR
object by its
\fInisNetgroupTriple\fR
attribute.
For example, OpenLDAP's
\fBslapd\fR
requires the following change to the
\fInisNetgroupTriple\fR
attribute:
.nf
.sp
.RS 10n
attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.1.1.1.14 NAME 'nisNetgroupTriple'
   DESC 'Netgroup triple'
   EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match

   SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26 )
.RE
.fi
.RS 6n
.sp
Before enabling
\fBNETGROUP_BASE\fR,
you should verify that your LDAP server supports matching
\fInisNetgroupTriple\fR.
For example, using
\fBldapsearch\fR:
.nf
.sp
.RS 10n
$ ldapsearch -b $NETGROUP_BASE \e
  '(&(objectClass=nisNetgroup)(nisNetgroupTriple=\e28*,USER,\e29))'
.RE
.fi
.sp
where your
\fInisNetgroup\fR
data includes an object with the following
\fInisNetgroupTriple\fR:
.sp
.RS 12n
nisNetgroupTriple: (,USER,)
.RE
.RE
.TP 6n
\fBNETGROUP_QUERY\fR \fIon/true/yes/off/false/no\fR
The
\fBNETGROUP_QUERY\fR
parameter indicates whether or not the LDAP server supports querying
\fInisNetgroup\fR
objects by matching on
\fInisNetgroupTriple\fR
attributes.
By default,
\fBsudoers\fR
expects to be able to perform queries that match on
\fInisNetgroupTriple\fR
attributes when
\fBNETGROUP_BASE\fR
is set, but not all LDAP servers support this.
.sp
If

.TP 6n
\fBNETGROUP_SEARCH_FILTER\fR \fIldap_filter\fR
An LDAP filter which is used to restrict the set of records returned
when performing an LDAP netgroup query.
Typically, this is of the form
\(oqattribute=value\(cq
or
\(oq(&(attribute=value)(attribute2=value2))\(cq.
The default search filter is:
\(oqobjectClass=nisNetgroup\(cq.
If
\fIldap_filter\fR
is omitted, no search filter will be used.
.sp
This option is only used when querying netgroups directly via LDAP.
.TP 6n
\fBNETWORK_TIMEOUT\fR \fIseconds\fR
An alias for
\fBBIND_TIMELIMIT\fR
provided for OpenLDAP compatibility.
.TP 6n
\fBPORT\fR \fIport_number\fR
If no
\fBURI\fR
is specified, the
\fBPORT\fR
parameter specifies the default port to connect to on the LDAP server if a
\fBHOST\fR
parameter does not specify the port itself.
If no
\fBPORT\fR
parameter is used, the default is port 389 for LDAP and port 636 for LDAP
over TLS (SSL).
The
\fBPORT\fR
parameter is deprecated in favor of the
\fBURI\fR
specification and is included for backward compatibility only.
.TP 6n
\fBROOTBINDDN\fR \fIDN\fR
The
\fBROOTBINDDN\fR
parameter specifies the identity, in the form of a Distinguished Name (DN),
to use when performing privileged LDAP operations, such as
\fIsudoers\fR
queries.
The password corresponding to the identity should be stored in the
or the path specified by the
\fIldap_secret\fR
plugin argument in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@),
which defaults to
\fI@ldap_secret@\fR.
If no
\fBROOTBINDDN\fR

\fBBINDDN\fR
identity is used (if any).
.TP 6n
\fBROOTUSE_SASL\fR \fIon/true/yes/off/false/no\fR
Enable
\fBROOTUSE_SASL\fR
to enable SASL authentication when connecting
to an LDAP server from a privileged process, such as
\fBsudo\fR.
.TP 6n
\fBSASL_AUTH_ID\fR \fIidentity\fR
The SASL user name to use when connecting to the LDAP server.
By default,
\fBsudo\fR
will use an anonymous connection.
.sp
This option is only relevant when using SASL authentication.
.TP 6n
\fBSASL_MECH\fR \fImechanisms\fR
A white space-delimited list of SASL authentication mechanisms to use.
By default,
\fBsudo\fR

This option is only relevant when using SASL authentication.
.TP 6n
\fBSSL\fR \fIon/true/yes/off/false/no\fR
If the
\fBSSL\fR
parameter is set to
\fIon\fR,
\fItrue\fR,
or
\fIyes\fR
TLS (SSL) encryption is always used when communicating with the LDAP server.
Typically, this involves connecting to the server on port 636 (ldaps).
.TP 6n
\fBSSL\fR \fIstart_tls\fR
If the
\fBSSL\fR
parameter is set to
\fIstart_tls\fR,
the LDAP server connection is initiated normally and TLS encryption is
begun before the bind credentials are sent.
This has the advantage of not requiring a dedicated port for encrypted
communications.
This parameter is only supported by LDAP servers that honor the
\fIstart_tls\fR
extension, such as the OpenLDAP and IBM Tivoli Directory servers.
.TP 6n
\fBSUDOERS_BASE\fR \fIbase\fR
The base DN to use when performing
\fBsudo\fR
LDAP queries.
Typically this is of the form
\(oqou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com\(cq
for the domain my-domain.com.
Multiple
\fBSUDOERS_BASE\fR
lines may be specified, in which case they are queried in the order specified.
.TP 6n
\fBSUDOERS_DEBUG\fR \fIdebug_level\fR
This sets the debug level for
\fBsudo\fR
LDAP queries.
Debugging information is printed to the standard error.
A value of 1 results in a moderate amount of debugging information.
A value of 2 shows the results of the matches themselves.
This parameter should not be set in a production environment as the
extra information is likely to confuse users.
.sp
The
\fBSUDOERS_DEBUG\fR
parameter is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
The same information is now logged via the
\fBsudo\fR
debugging framework using the
\(lqldap\(rq
subsystem at priorities
\fIdiag\fR
and
\fIinfo\fR
for
\fIdebug_level\fR
values 1 and 2 respectively.
See the
sudo.conf(@mansectform@)
manual for details on how to configure
\fBsudo\fR
debugging.
.TP 6n
\fBSUDOERS_SEARCH_FILTER\fR \fIldap_filter\fR
An LDAP filter which is used to restrict the set of records returned
when performing a
\fBsudo\fR
LDAP query.
Typically, this is of the
form
\(oqattribute=value\(cq
or
\(oq(&(attribute=value)(attribute2=value2))\(cq.
The default search filter is:
\(oqobjectClass=sudoRole\(cq.
If
\fIldap_filter\fR
is omitted, no search filter will be used.
.TP 6n
\fBSUDOERS_TIMED\fR \fIon/true/yes/off/false/no\fR
Whether or not to evaluate the
\fIsudoNotBefore\fR

.TP 6n
\fBTIMELIMIT\fR \fIseconds\fR
The
\fBTIMELIMIT\fR
parameter specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a
response to an LDAP query.
.TP 6n
\fBTIMEOUT\fR \fIseconds\fR
The
\fBTIMEOUT\fR
parameter specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a
response from the various LDAP APIs.
.TP 6n
\fBTLS_CACERT\fR \fIfile name\fR
An alias for
\fBTLS_CACERTFILE\fR
for OpenLDAP compatibility.
.TP 6n
\fBTLS_CACERTFILE\fR \fIfile name\fR
The path to a certificate authority bundle which contains the certificates
for all the Certificate Authorities the client knows to be valid, e.g.,
\fI/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem\fR.
.sp
This option is only supported by the OpenLDAP libraries.
Netscape-derived LDAP libraries use the same certificate
database for CA and client certificates (see
\fBTLS_CERT\fR).
.TP 6n
\fBTLS_CACERTDIR\fR \fIdirectory\fR
Similar to
\fBTLS_CACERTFILE\fR
but instead of a file, it is a directory containing individual
Certificate Authority certificates, e.g.,
\fI/etc/ssl/certs\fR.
The directory specified by
\fBTLS_CACERTDIR\fR
is checked after
\fBTLS_CACERTFILE\fR.
.sp
This option is only supported by the OpenLDAP libraries.
.TP 6n
\fBTLS_CERT\fR \fIfile name\fR

\fBTLS_CHECKPEER\fR \fIon/true/yes/off/false/no\fR
If enabled,
\fBTLS_CHECKPEER\fR
will cause the LDAP server's TLS certificated to be verified.
If the server's TLS certificate cannot be verified (usually because it
is signed by an unknown certificate authority),
\fBsudo\fR
will be unable to connect to it.
If
\fBTLS_CHECKPEER\fR
is disabled, no check is made.
Disabling this check creates an opportunity for man-in-the-middle
attacks since the server's identity will not be authenticated.
If possible, the CA's certificate should be installed locally so it can
be verified.
.sp
This option is not supported by the IBM LDAP libraries.
.TP 6n
\fBTLS_KEY\fR \fIfile name\fR
The path to a file containing the private key which matches the

\fBTLS_CIPHERS\fR \fIcipher list\fR
The
\fBTLS_CIPHERS\fR
parameter allows the administer to restrict which encryption algorithms
may be used for TLS (SSL) connections.
See the OpenLDAP or IBM Tivoli Directory Server manual for a list of valid
ciphers.
.sp
This option is not supported by Netscape-derived libraries.
.TP 6n
\fBTLS_KEYPW\fR \fIsecret\fR
The
\fBTLS_KEYPW\fR
contains the password used to decrypt the key database on clients
using the IBM LDAP library.
The
\fIsecret\fR
may be a plaintext password or a base64-encoded string with a
\(lqbase64:\(rq
prefix.
For example:
.nf
.sp
.RS 10n
TLS_KEYPW base64:dGVzdA==
.RE
.fi
.RS 6n
.sp
If a plaintext password is used, it should be a simple string without quotes.
Plain text passwords may not include the comment character
(\(oq#\(cq)
and the escaping of special characters with a backslash
(\(oq\e\(cq)
is not supported.
If this option is used,
\fI@ldap_conf@\fR
must not be world-readable to avoid exposing the password.
Alternately, a
\fIstash file\fR
can be used to store the password in encrypted form (see below).
.sp
If no
\fBTLS_KEYPW\fR
is specified, a
\fIstash file\fR
will be used if it exists.
The
\fIstash file\fR
must have the same path as the file specified by
\fBTLS_KEY\fR,
but use a
\(oq.sth\(cq
file extension instead of
\(oq.kdb\(cq,
for example
\(oqldapkey.sth\(cq.
The default
\(oqldapkey.kdb\(cq
that ships with the IBM Tivoli Directory Server is encrypted with the password
\(oqssl_password\(cq.
The
\fIgsk8capicmd\fR

.TP 6n
\fBTLS_REQCERT\fR \fIlevel\fR
The
\fBTLS_REQCERT\fR

verified (if at all).
If the server's TLS certificate cannot be verified (usually because it
is signed by an unknown certificate authority),
\fBsudo\fR

.TP 6n
\fBURI\fR \fIldap[s]://[hostname[:port]] ...\fR
Specifies a white space-delimited list of one or more URIs describing
the LDAP server(s) to connect to.
The
\fIprotocol\fR
may be either
\fIldap\fR
\fIldaps\fR,
the latter being for servers that support TLS (SSL) encryption.
If no
\fIport\fR

\(oqldap://\(cq
or port 636 for
\(oqldaps://\(cq.
If no
\fIhostname\fR
is specified,
\fBsudo\fR
will connect to
\fIlocalhost\fR.
Multiple
\fBURI\fR

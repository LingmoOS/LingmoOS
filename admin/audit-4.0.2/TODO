Future roadmap (subject to change):
===================================
4.0.x
* In auditd, look into non-blocking handling of write to plugins
* Basic HIDS based on reactive audit component
* Multi-thread audisp-remote
* Support multiple time streams when searching
* If searching user/group doesn't map to uid/gid, do translated string search

4.1
* Support TLS PSK as remote logging transport
* audisp-remote, add config to say what home network is so laptops don't try if their not on a network that can reach the server.
* Change ausearch to output name="" unless its a real null. (mount) ausearch-report.c, 523. FIXME

Someday...
* Container support
* Rewrite swig based python

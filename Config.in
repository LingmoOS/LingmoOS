	  Note that Buildroot does not try to invalidate the cache

	default y
	help
	  Allow ccache to convert absolute paths within the output
	  directory into relative paths.

	  During the build, many -I include directives are given with an
	  absolute path. These absolute paths end up in the hashes that
	  are computed by ccache. Therefore, when you build from a
	  different directory, the hash will be different and the cached
	  object will not be used.

	  To improve cache performance, set this option to y. This
	  allows ccache to rewrite absolute paths within the output
	  directory into relative paths. Note that only paths within the
	  output directory will be rewritten; therefore, if you change
	  LINGMO_HOST_DIR to point outside the output directory and
	  subsequently move it to a different location, this will lead
	  to cache misses.

	  This option has as a result that the debug information in the
	  object files also has only relative paths. Therefore, make
	  sure you cd to the build directory before starting gdb. See
	  the section "COMPILING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTORIES" in the ccache
	  manual for more information.

	      explicitly expressed, and not other packages that may
	      have by chance been built before.

	    - Enable top-level parallel build.

	  This is labeled as an experimental feature, as not all
	  packages behave properly with per-package directories.

	  This option will pass -D_TIME_BITS=64 in the compiler flags

	  This option only has an effect with glibc >= 2.34, as

	  Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
	  smashing attacks. This is done by adding a guard variable to
	  functions with vulnerable objects. This includes functions
	  that call alloca, and functions with buffers larger than 8

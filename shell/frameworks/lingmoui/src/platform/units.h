     * Time in milliseconds equivalent to the theoretical human moment, which can be used
     * to determine whether how long to wait until the user should be informed of something,
     * or can be used as the limit for how long something should wait before being
     * automatically initiated.
     *
     * Some examples:
     *
     * - When the user types text in a search field, wait no longer than this duration after
     *   the user completes typing before starting the search
     * - When loading data which would commonly arrive rapidly enough to not require interaction,
     *   wait this long before showing a spinner
     *
     * This might seem an arbitrary number, but given the psychological effect that three
     * seconds seems to be what humans consider a moment (and in the case of waiting for
     * something to happen, a moment is that time when you think "this is taking a bit long,
     * isn't it?"), the idea is to postpone for just before such a conceptual moment. The reason
     * for the two seconds, rather than three, is to function as a middle ground: Not long enough
     * that the user would think that something has taken too long, for also not so fast as to
     * happen too soon.
     *
     * See also
     * https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-addiction/201101/tick-tock-tick-hugs-and-life-in-3-second-intervals
     * (the actual paper is hidden behind an academic paywall and consequently not readily
     * available to us, so the source will have to be the blog entry above)
     *
     * \note This should __not__ be used as an animation duration, as it is deliberately not scaled according
     * to the animation settings. This is specifically for determining when something has taken too long and
     * the user should expect some kind of feedback. See veryShortDuration, shortDuration, longDuration, and
     * veryLongDuration for animation duration choices.

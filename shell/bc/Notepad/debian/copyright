Comment:
 KDE software follows the KDE licensing policy that can be found:
 https://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy
 Some files might refer to license names that are explained it these the
 mentioned policy.
 .
 Unless otherwise noted the default license used in this application is
 LGPL-2.1+ for the source code and GFDL-NIV-1.2+ for the documentation.
 Some of the optional plugins used at runtime are under a version of
 the GPL license.
 .
 In particular, this licensing allows this project to link against libgit2
 (which may, in turn, link against the openssl, which has incompatibilities
 with the GPL),  as the code that links against this is the kateprojectplugin,
 that is under a  version of the LGPL, so the incompatibilities don't apply.
 .
 On the other hand, in order to link against the ktexteditor framework
 (which may, in turn, link against libgit2), either the libgit2 needs to be
 linked against gnutls or ktexteditor needs to not be linked against libgit2.

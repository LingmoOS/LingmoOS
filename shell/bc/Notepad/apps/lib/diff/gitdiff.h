/**
 * A class representing a unified diff, possibly with
 * conflict markers.
 *
 * A diff is assumed to be a collection of hunks, where each hunk has the
 * following structure:
 *
 *   METADATA
 *   --- a/SOURCE_PATH
 *   +++ b/TARGET_PATH
 *   HUNK1 HEADER
 *   HUNK1 CONTENT
 *   [METADATA]
 *   HUNK2 HEADER
 *   HUNK2 CONTENT
 *   ...
 *
 * METADATA are lines which start with anything except for a '+', '-' and ' '.
 * The path specifications may optionally precede a hunk and are assumed to
 * apply to all following hunks until a new path specification
 * is found. These indicate the files for which the diff is generated.
 *
 * Hunk Header
 * ------------
 *
 * Each hunk header has the following form
 *
 *   @@ -SRC_OFFSET[, SRC_CHANGES_COUNT] +TGT_OFFSET[, TGT_CHANGES_COUNT] @@ Heading
 *
 * where the SRC_OFFSET is a 1-based line index pointing to the source file where
 * the hunk applies and TGT_OFFSET is a 1-based line index pointing to the target
 * file where the hunk applies. The optional SRC_CHANGES_COUNTS (assumed to be 1
 * if not present) specifies the number of context lines plus the number of
 * deleted lines. Similarly, the optional TGT_CHANGES_COUNT specifies the
 * number of context lines plus the number of added lines. The Heading, used as a
 * visual aid for users, is supposed to show the line where the nearest enclosing
 * function scope of the hunk starts.
 *
 * Hunk Content
 * ------------
 *
 * The hunk content is a collection of lines which starting with '+' (additions),
 * '-' (deletions) and ' ' (context lines; empty lines are also take to be context
 * lines). Additionally, a hunk may contain conflict markers which are of the form
 *
 *   >>>>>>> our ref
 *   our content
 *   ...
 *   =======
 *   their content
 *   ...
 *   <<<<<<< their ref
 *
 * and indicate unresolved conflicts.

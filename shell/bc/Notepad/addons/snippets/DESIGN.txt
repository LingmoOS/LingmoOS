1. Basics
Snippets and repositoryies get displayed as tree.

Snippets are grouped into repositories, which are saved as XML files to disk.
The XML format is the same as used in the snippets_tng plugin for Kate.

We look for available repository files via QStandardPaths in share/ktexteditor_snippets/{data,ghns}/.

After importing, the repository and it's snippets and sup-repositories show
up in the snippet tree and the snippets can be inserted like normal code-completion items.

2. Editing
Snipets and repositories can be edited via the contextmenu of the snippet tree.

Changing a repository's name will also rename the file from which the snippet has
been loaded.

3. Contents of a snippet
A snippet can contain any kind of text. A snippet's text will inserted into the
currently active document uppon doubleclicking a snippet from the tree or by
executing it's completion item.

The snippets content's can contain variables, see the documentation of KTextEditor::TemplateInterface
for more information.

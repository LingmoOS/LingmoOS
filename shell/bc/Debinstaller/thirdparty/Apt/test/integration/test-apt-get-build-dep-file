Description: install packages using the apt protocol - common data
 AptUrl is a simple graphical application that takes an URL (which follows the
 apt-protocol) as a command line option, parses it and carries out the
 operations that the URL describes (that is, it asks the user if he wants the
 indicated packages to be installed and if the answer is positive does so for
 him).
 .
 This package contains the common data shared between the frontends.

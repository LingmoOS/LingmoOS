Stuff to do
-----------
 - Actions
   - action to clear file dialog history
   - action to clear recent files (maybe be same as above)
     - this might suck, each app maintains its own list of recent files
   - "better underlying framework"
   - maybe an action to execute an arbitrary shell script?
 
 - P3P
   - http://www.w3.org/P3P/
   - needs investigation
     - collaboration with Konq people too

 - Profiles
   - small dialog to define profiles (collections of actions)
   - associate profiles by name
   - load profiles in the GUI
   - call specific profiles via dcop
 
 - GUI
   - still Qt3, that will have to be fixed
     - might redesign in the process anyway
 
 - DCOP
   - exists now, but will see larger updates as other TODOs progress

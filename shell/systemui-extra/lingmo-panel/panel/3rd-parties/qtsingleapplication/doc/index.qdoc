	\title Single Application

    	\section1 Description
	
			The QtSingleApplication component provides support
			for applications that can be only started once per user.
		

	
			For some applications it is useful or even critical that they are started
			only once by any user. Future attempts to start the application should
			activate any already running instance, and possibly perform requested
			actions, e.g. loading a file, in that instance.

			The QtSingleApplication class provides an interface to detect a running
			instance, and to send command strings to that instance.
	                For console (non-GUI) applications, the QtSingleCoreApplication variant is provided, which avoids dependency on QtGui.

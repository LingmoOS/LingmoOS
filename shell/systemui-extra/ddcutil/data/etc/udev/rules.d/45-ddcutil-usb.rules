# Rules for USB attached monitors, which are categorized as User Interface Devices. 

# The following example rules assign USB connected monitors to group video, and give RW permission
# to users in that group.  Alternatively, you can give everyone RW permission for monitor devices by 
# changing 'MODE="0660", GROUP="video"' to 'MODE="0666"'. 

# Use ddcutil to check if a USB Human Interface Device appears to be a monitor. 
# Note this rule will have to be adjusted to reflect the actual path where ddcutil is installed. 
# The -v option produces informational messages.  These are lost when the rule is normally executed 
# udev, but can be helpful when rules are tested using the "udevadm test" command. 
SUBSYSTEM=="usbmisc",  KERNEL=="hiddev*", PROGRAM="/usr/bin/ddcutil chkusbmon $env{DEVNAME} -v", MODE="0660", GROUP="video"

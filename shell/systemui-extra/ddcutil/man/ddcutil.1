.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBddcutil\fP is used to query and change monitor settings.  

\fBddcutil\fP communicates with monitors that implement the Monitor Control Command Set (MCCS) using the DDC/CI protocol on an I2C bus.  
Normally, the video driver for the monitor exposes the I2C bus as devices named /dev/i2c-n.  
Alternatively, \fBddcutil\fP can communicate monitors that use USB to communicate MMCS, provided the monitors meet the USB Monitor Control Class Specification.

The Monitor Control Command Set describes a collection of Virtual Control Panel (VCP) features that a monitor can implement.
Each feature is identified using a single byte.  For example, feature x10 is the brightness control. 

The monitor settings that can be controlled by \fBddcutil\fP are generally speaking those that can be changed using the buttons
on a monitor and its on screen display.  The specific capabilities vary from monitor to monitor.

A particular use case for \fBddcutil\fP is as part of color profile management.  
Monitor calibration is relative to the monitor color settings currently in effect, e.g. red gain.  
\fBddcutil\fP allows color related settings to be saved at the time a monitor is calibrated, 
and then restored when the calibration is applied.

Another common use case is to switch the monitor input source. 

This man page focuses on the \fBddcutil\fP commands and options most important to the typical user. 
For complete documentation, use the \fI--help\fP option or see the web site

More generally, this is actually a two byte value, i.e. x00..xffff, and a few features use this 
extended range.

.PP
Feature selection filters
.TQ
.B "-U, --show-unsupported"
Normally, \fBgetvcp\fP does not report unsupported features when querying a feature-group.  This option forces output. 
.TQ
.B "--show-table | --no-table
Normally, \fBgetvcp\fP does not report Table type features when querying a feature-group.  \fB--show-table\fP forces output.   \fB--no-table\fP is the default.
.TQ
.B "--rw, --ro, --wo"
Limit \fBgetvcp\fP or \fBvcpinfo\fP output to read-write, read-only, or (for \fBvcpinfo\fP) write-only features.

.PP
Options that control the amount and form of output.
.TQ
.B "-t, --terse, --brief"
Show brief detail.  For command \fBgetvcp\fP, the output is in machine readable form.
.TQ
.B -v, --verbose
Show extended detail

.PP
Options that modify behavior
.TQ
.BI "--mccs " "MCCS version"
Tailor command input and 
output to a particular MCCS version, e.g. 2.1
.TQ
.B "--enable-usb, --disable-usb"
Enable or disable support for monitors that implement USB commuincation with the Virtual Control Panel.
The default is 
.B "--disable-usb"
.TQ
.B "--enable-udf, --disable-udf"
Enable or disable support for user supplied feature definitions.
The default is
.B "--enable-udf"
.TQ
.B "enable-capabilities-cache, --disable-capabilities-cache"
Enable or disable caching of capabilities strings, improving performance.
The default is
.B "--enable-capabilities-cache

Take control of slave addresses on the I2C bus even they are in use.
.TQ
.B "--verify | --noverify"
Verify or do not verify values set by \fBsetvcp\fP or \fBloadvcp\fP. \fB--noverify\fP is the default.
.TQ
.B "--async"
If there are multiple monitors, initial checks are performed in multiple threads, improving performance.
.TQ
.BI "--edid-read-size " "128|256"
Force \fBddcutil\fP to read the specified number of bytes when reading the EDID.
This option is a work-around for certain driver bugs.
The default is 256. 

.PP
Options to tune execution:
.TQ
.BI "--maxtries " "(max-read-tries, max-write-read-tries, max-multi-part-tries)"
Adjust the number of retries.  A value of "." or "0" leaves the setting for a retry type unchanged.
.TQ
.BI "--sleep-multiplier " "decimal number"
Adjust the length of waits listed in the DDC/CI specification by this number to determine the actual 
wait time.  Well behaved monitors work with sleep-multiplier values less than 1.0, while monitors
with poor DDC implementations may work better with sleep-multiplier values greater than 1.0. 


.PP
Options for diagnostic output.
.TQ
.BR --stats " [" all | errors | tries | calls | elapsed | time ]
Report execution statistics.  If no argument is specified, or ALL is specified, then all statistics are 
output.  \fBelapsed\fP is a synonym for \fBtime\fP.  \fBcalls\fP implies \fBtime\fP.
.br Specify this option multiple times to report multiple statistics groups.
.br
I2C bus communication is an inherently unreliable.  It is the responsibility of the program using the bus 
to manage retries in case of failure.  This option reports retry counts and various performance statistics.
.TQ
.B --ddc
Reports DDC protocol errors.  These may reflect I2C bus errors, or deviations by monitors from the MCCS specification.

.PP
Debugging options. 
.TQ
.BI "--trace "  "trace group name"

.SH EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT 

Requires read/write access to /dev/i2c devices.  See 
.UR http://www.ddcutil.com/i2c_permissions
.UE

.SH NVIDIA PROPRIETARY DRIVER

Some Nvidia cards using the proprietary Nvidia driver require special settings to properly enable I2C support.  See 
.UR http://www.ddcutil.com/nvidia
.UE .


.SH VIRTUAL MACHINES

Virtualized video drivers in VMWare and VirtualBox do not provide I2C emulation.  Use of normal video drivers with PCI passthrough 
is possible.

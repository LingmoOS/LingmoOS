// This class file provides both RDRAND and RDSEED. They were added at
//   Crypto++ 5.6.3. At compile time, it uses CRYPTOPP_BOOL_{X86|X32|X64}
//   to select an implementation or "throw NotImplemented". At runtime the
//   constructor will throw RDRAND_Err or RDSEED_Err if a generator is
//   is not available.
// The original classes accepted a retry count. Retries were superflous for
//   RDRAND, and RDSEED encountered a failure about 1 in 256 bytes depending
//   on the processor. Retries were removed at Crypto++ 6.0 because
//   GenerateBlock unconditionally retries and always fulfills the request.

// Throughput varies wildly depending on processor and manufacturer. A Core i5 or
//   Core i7 RDRAND can generate at over 200 MiB/s. It is below the theroetical
//   maximum, but it takes about 5 instructions to generate, retry and store a
//   result. A low-end Celeron may perform RDRAND at about 7 MiB/s. RDSEED
//   performs at about 1/4 to 1/2 the rate of RDRAND. AMD RDRAND performed poorly
//   during testing with Athlon X4 845. The Bulldozer v4 only performed at 1 MiB/s.

// Microsoft added RDRAND in August 2012, VS2012; RDSEED in October 2013, VS2013.
// GCC added RDRAND in December 2010, GCC 4.6. LLVM added RDRAND in July 2012,
// Clang 3.2. Intel added RDRAND in September 2011, ICC 12.1.

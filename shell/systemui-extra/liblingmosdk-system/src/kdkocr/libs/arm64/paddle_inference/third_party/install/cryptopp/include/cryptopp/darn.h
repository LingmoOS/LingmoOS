// darn.h - written and placed in public domain by Jeffrey Walton
//          DARN requires POWER9/ISA 3.0.

// At the moment only GCC 7.0 (and above) seems to support __builtin_darn()
// and __builtin_darn_32(). Clang 7.0 does not provide them, but it does
// support assembly instructions. XLC is unknown, but there are no hits when
// searching IBM's site. To cover more platforms we provide GCC inline
// assembly like we do with RDRAND and RDSEED. Platforms that don't support
// GCC inline assembly or the builtin will fail the compile. Also see
// https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Basic-PowerPC-Built-in-Functions-Available-on-ISA-3_002e0.html

        Set window state. Can set multiple states at once.

        Values for state argument are described by org_lingmo_window_management.state and can be used

        The flags bitfield describes which flags are supposed to be set, the
        state bitfield the value for the set flags.

        The state argument is not a boolean value, but a bitfield, so it is possible to set multiple
        states at once. Only the states that are set in the flags bitfield will be changed.

        For example:

        If flags was 0x14(keep_above|maximized) and state was 0x04(maximized), the window would be
        maximized, but not keep above.

        If flags was 0x04(maximized) and state was 0x14(keep_above|maximized), the window would be

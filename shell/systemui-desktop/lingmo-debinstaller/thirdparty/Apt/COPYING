Comment:
 APT is an old software with lots of contributors over its lifetime. This
 file is a best effort to document the statements of copyright and licenses
 as stated in the file, but is not a complete representation of all copyright
 holders - those have been lost to times.
 .
 Several bits of apt-pkg/contrib have had public domain dedications but
 contributions from authors in countries not recognizing a public domain
 concept. We believe that these contributions have been done in good faith,
 and we treat them as if they had been made under the GPL-2+ as we believe
 some contributors may have missed these facts and the overall license statement
 for the project has always been GPL-2+, so we cannot be sure that contributors
 meant to grant additional permissions.
 .
 Translation files are considered to generally be GPL-2+,
 but they also include strings used by methods/rsh.cc which appears to be GPL-2.
 As the translations are split into separate domains later on,
 these strings are not loaded by library users outside of apt
 (they are in the 'apt' translation domain).
 .
 The apt-pkg/contrib/fileutl.cc file states "RunScripts()" is "GPLv2".
 We believe that this was not meant to exclude later versions of the GPL,
 as that would have changed the overall project license.

Comment:
 This file stated:
 Licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 [no exception clauses]
 .
 We believe that this was intended to be not a statement against future
 versions of the GPL, but meant to exclude the Qt license exception in
 place in APT until that time.
 .
 We received permission from Ben in 2021 to relicense under GPL-2+,
 contributions from Adam Heath and Daniel Hartwig may still have to
 be considered GPL-2 for the time being.
 .
 Other contributions are GPL-2+

liblingmo

This directory contains the classes making up liblingmo, which provides the
core framework used by Lingmo applications, such as the Lingmo desktop shell
and its components. This includes applet and extension definitions and loading,
common GUI elements, data and service interaction, search system, etc.

Domain specific sets of functionality, e.g. for network awareness or sensors,
are not found here but as Applet, Wallpaper,
ContainmentActions, Containment and other plugins.

Commit Guidelines:
* If your patch is not an obvious or trivial bug fix, have it peer reviewed
  by another Lingmo developer; https://phabricator.kde.org is your friend :)

* All code MUST follow the KDE Frameworks coding style, as found at:
        https://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Frameworks_Coding_Style

* All new public API MUST have apidox written before committing and must go
  through an API review with another Lingmo developer. We have to maintain
  binary compatibility, remember!

Unit tests are next to godliness. (Though as you can see, right now liblingmo
is hellbound.)

Please refer to the Lingmo website (https://lingmo.kde.org) and Lingmo wiki
(https://community.kde.org/Lingmo) for API documentation and design
documents regarding this library.

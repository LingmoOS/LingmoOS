Lingmo Applet Template
----------------------

-- Namespace adaption --

Each Lingmo plugin has a unique identifier, which is also used to find related
resources (like the translation catalogs).
To avoid naming collisions, Lingmo plugins use a reverse domain name notation
for that identifier:

* org.kde.lingmo.* - plugins coming from Lingmo modules
* org.kde.*        - plugins coming from other software from KDE
* $(my.domain).*   - plugins of your 3rd-party

The generated code uses the "org.kde.lingmo" namespace for the plugin identifier.
As this namespace is reserved for use by plugins part of Lingmo modules, you will
need to adapt this namespace if you are writing a plugin which is not intended to
end up in the Lingmo modules.


-- Build instructions --

cd /where/your/applet/is/generated
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=MYPREFIX .. 
make

(MYPREFIX is where you install your Lingmo setup, replace it accordingly)

Restart lingmo to load the applet 
(in a terminal type: 
kquitapp lingmoshell 
and then
lingmoshell)

or view it with 
plasmoidviewer -a YourAppletName

/* This condvar implementation guarantees that all calls to signal and
   broadcast and all of the three virtually atomic parts of each call to wait
   (i.e., (1) releasing the mutex and blocking, (2) unblocking, and (3) re-
   acquiring the mutex) happen in some total order that is consistent with the
   happens-before relations in the calling program.  However, this order does
   not necessarily result in additional happens-before relations being
   established (which aligns well with spurious wake-ups being allowed).

   All waiters acquire a certain position in a 64b waiter sequence (__wseq).
   This sequence determines which waiters are allowed to consume signals.
   A broadcast is equal to sending as many signals as are unblocked waiters.
   When a signal arrives, it samples the current value of __wseq with a
   relaxed-MO load (i.e., the position the next waiter would get).  (This is
   sufficient because it is consistent with happens-before; the caller can
   enforce stronger ordering constraints by calling signal while holding the
   mutex.)  Only waiters with a position less than the __wseq value observed
   by the signal are eligible to consume this signal.

   This would be straight-forward to implement if waiters would just spin but
   we need to let them block using futexes.  Futexes give no guarantee of
   waking in FIFO order, so we cannot reliably wake eligible waiters if we
   just use a single futex.  Also, futex words are 32b in size, but we need
   to distinguish more than 1<<32 states because we need to represent the
   order of wake-up (and thus which waiters are eligible to consume signals);
   blocking in a futex is not atomic with a waiter determining its position in
   the waiter sequence, so we need the futex word to reliably notify waiters
   that they should not attempt to block anymore because they have been
   already signaled in the meantime.  While an ABA issue on a 32b value will
   be rare, ignoring it when we are aware of it is not the right thing to do
   either.

   Therefore, we use a 64b counter to represent the waiter sequence (on
   architectures which only support 32b atomics, we use a few bits less).
   To deal with the blocking using futexes, we maintain two groups of waiters:
   * Group G1 consists of waiters that are all eligible to consume signals;
     incoming signals will always signal waiters in this group until all
     waiters in G1 have been signaled.
   * Group G2 consists of waiters that arrive when a G1 is present and still
     contains waiters that have not been signaled.  When all waiters in G1
     are signaled and a new signal arrives, the new signal will convert G2
     into the new G1 and create a new G2 for future waiters.

   We cannot allocate new memory because of process-shared condvars, so we
   have just two slots of groups that change their role between G1 and G2.
   Each has a separate futex word, a number of signals available for
   consumption, a size (number of waiters in the group that have not been
   signaled), and a reference count.

   The group reference count is used to maintain the number of waiters that
   are using the group's futex.

   To represent which intervals in the waiter sequence the groups cover (and
   thus also which group slot contains G1 or G2), we use a 64b counter to
   designate the start position of G1 (inclusive), and a single bit in the
   waiter sequence counter to represent which group slot currently contains
   G2.  This allows us to switch group roles atomically wrt. waiters obtaining
   a position in the waiter sequence.  The G1 start position allows waiters to
   figure out whether they are in a group that has already been completely
   signaled (i.e., if the current G1 starts at a later position that the
   waiter's position).  Waiters cannot determine whether they are currently
   in G2 or G1 -- but they do not have to because all they are interested in
   is whether there are available signals, and they always start in G2 (whose
   group slot they know because of the bit in the waiter sequence.  Signalers
   will simply fill the right group until it is completely signaled and can
   be closed (they do not switch group roles until they really have to to
   decrease the likelihood of having to wait for waiters still holding a
   reference on the now-closed G1).

   Signalers maintain the initial size of G1 to be able to determine where
   G2 starts (G2 is always open-ended until it becomes G1).  They track the
   remaining size of a group; when waiters cancel waiting (due to PThreads
   cancellation or timeouts), they will decrease this remaining size as well.

   To implement condvar destruction requirements (i.e., that
   pthread_cond_destroy can be called as soon as all waiters have been
   signaled), waiters increment a reference count before starting to wait and
   decrement it after they stopped waiting but right before they acquire the
   mutex associated with the condvar.

   pthread_cond_t thus consists of the following (bits that are used for
   flags and are not part of the primary value of each field but necessary
   to make some things atomic or because there was no space for them
   elsewhere in the data structure):

   __wseq: Waiter sequence counter
     * LSB is index of current G2.
     * Waiters fetch-add while having acquire the mutex associated with the
       condvar.  Signalers load it and fetch-xor it concurrently.
   __g1_start: Starting position of G1 (inclusive)
     * Modified by signalers while having acquired the condvar-internal lock
       and observed concurrently by waiters.
   __g1_orig_size: Initial size of G1
     * The two least-significant bits represent the condvar-internal lock.
     * Only accessed while having acquired the condvar-internal lock.
   __wrefs: Waiter reference counter.
     * Bit 2 is true if waiters should run futex_wake when they remove the
       last reference.  pthread_cond_destroy uses this as futex word.
     * Bit 1 is the clock ID (0 == CLOCK_REALTIME, 1 == CLOCK_MONOTONIC).
     * Bit 0 is true iff this is a process-shared condvar.
     * Simple reference count used by both waiters and pthread_cond_destroy.
     (If the format of __wrefs is changed, update nptl_lock_constants.pysym
      and the pretty printers.)
   For each of the two groups, we have:
   __g_refs: Futex waiter reference count.
     * LSB is true if waiters should run futex_wake when they remove the
       last reference.
     * Reference count used by waiters concurrently with signalers that have
       acquired the condvar-internal lock.
   __g_signals: The number of signals that can still be consumed, relative to
     the current g1_start.  (i.e. g1_start with the signal count added)
     * Used as a futex word by waiters.  Used concurrently by waiters and
       signalers.
   __g_size: Waiters remaining in this group (i.e., which have not been
     signaled yet.
     * Accessed by signalers and waiters that cancel waiting (both do so only
       when having acquired the condvar-internal lock.
     * The size of G2 is always zero because it cannot be determined until
       the group becomes G1.
     * Although this is of unsigned type, we rely on using unsigned overflow
       rules to make this hold effectively negative values too (in
       particular, when waiters in G2 cancel waiting).

   A PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER condvar has all fields set to zero, which yields
   a condvar that has G2 starting at position 0 and a G1 that is closed.

   Because waiters do not claim ownership of a group right when obtaining a
   position in __wseq but only reference count the group when using futexes
   to block, it can happen that a group gets closed before a waiter can
   increment the reference count.  Therefore, waiters have to check whether
   their group is already closed using __g1_start.  They also have to perform
   this check when spinning when trying to grab a signal from __g_signals.
   Note that for these checks, using relaxed MO to load __g1_start is
   sufficient because if a waiter can see a sufficiently large value, it could
   have also consume a signal in the waiters group.


   Limitations:
   * This condvar isn't designed to allow for more than
     __PTHREAD_COND_MAX_GROUP_SIZE * (1 << 31) calls to __pthread_cond_wait.
   * More than __PTHREAD_COND_MAX_GROUP_SIZE concurrent waiters are not
     supported.
   * Beyond what is allowed as errors by POSIX or documented, we can also
     return the following errors:
     * EPERM if MUTEX is a recursive mutex and the caller doesn't own it.
     * EOWNERDEAD or ENOTRECOVERABLE when using robust mutexes.  Unlike
       for other errors, this can happen when we re-acquire the mutex; this
       isn't allowed by POSIX (which requires all errors to virtually happen
       before we release the mutex or change the condvar state), but there's
       nothing we can do really.
     * When using PTHREAD_MUTEX_PP_* mutexes, we can also return all errors
       returned by __pthread_tpp_change_priority.  We will already have
       released the mutex in such cases, so the caller cannot expect to own
       MUTEX.

   Other notes:
   * Instead of the normal mutex unlock / lock functions, we use
     __pthread_mutex_unlock_usercnt(m, 0) / __pthread_mutex_cond_lock(m)
     because those will not change the mutex-internal users count, so that it
     can be detected when a condvar is still associated with a particular
     mutex because there is a waiter blocked on this condvar using this mutex.

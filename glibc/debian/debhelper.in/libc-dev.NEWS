glibc (2.34-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with glibc 2.31, Sun RPC is removed from glibc. This includes the
  rpcgen program, librpcsvc, and the Sun RPC header files. However backward
  runtime compatibility is provided, that is to say existing binaries will
  continue to work.

  In order to link new binaries, the rpcsvc-proto package (a dependency of
  libc6-dev) provides rpcgen and several rpcsvc header files and RPC protocol
  definitions from Sun RPC sources that were previously shipped by glibc, and
  an alternative RPC library shall be used. The most used alternative library
  is TI-RPC, the corresponding development package is libtirpc-dev.

  Here are the necessary steps to switch an existing program to use the TI-RPC
  library:
  - Make sure the rpcsvc-proto, libtirpc-dev and pkg-config packages are
    installed.
  - Add the output of 'pkg-config --cflags libtirpc' to CFLAGS or equivalent.
  - Add the output of 'pkg-config --libs libtirpc' to LDFLAGS or equivalent.

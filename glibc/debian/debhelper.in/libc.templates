_Description: Do you want to upgrade glibc now?
 Running services and programs that are using NSS need to be restarted,
 otherwise they might not be able to do lookup or authentication any more.
 The installation process is able to restart some services (such as ssh or
 telnetd), but other programs cannot be restarted automatically. One such
 program that needs manual stopping and restart after the glibc upgrade by
 yourself is xdm - because automatic restart might disconnect your active
 X11 sessions.
 .
 This script detected the following installed services which must be
 stopped before the upgrade: ${services}
 .
 If you want to interrupt the upgrade now and continue later, please
 answer No to the question below.

Type: string
_Description: Services to restart for GNU libc library upgrade:
 Running services and programs that are using NSS need to be restarted,
 otherwise they might not be able to do lookup or authentication any more
 (for services such as ssh, this can affect your ability to login).
 Please review the following space-separated list of init.d scripts for
 services to be restarted now, and correct it if needed.

 Note: restarting sshd/telnetd should not affect any existing connections.

_Description: Failure restarting some services for GNU libc upgrade
 The following services could not be restarted for the GNU libc library upgrade:
 .
 ${services}
 .
 You will need to start these manually by running
 'invoke-rc.d <service> start'.

Template: glibc/disable-screensaver
Type: error
_Description: xscreensaver and xlockmore must be restarted before upgrading
 One or more running instances of xscreensaver or xlockmore have been
 detected on this system. Because of incompatible library changes, the
 upgrade of the GNU libc library will leave you unable to
 authenticate to these programs. You should arrange for these programs
 to be restarted or stopped before continuing this upgrade, to avoid
 locking your users out of their current sessions.

Template: libraries/restart-without-asking
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Restart services during package upgrades without asking?
 There are services installed on your system which need to be restarted
 when certain libraries, such as libpam, libc, and libssl, are upgraded.
 Since these restarts may cause interruptions of service for the system,
 you will normally be prompted on each upgrade for the list of services
 you wish to restart.  You can choose this option to avoid being prompted;
 instead, all necessary restarts will be done for you automatically so you
 can avoid being asked questions on each library upgrade.

Template: glibc/kernel-too-old
Type: error
_Description: Kernel must be upgraded
 This version of the GNU libc requires kernel version ${kernel_ver} or
 later.  Please upgrade your kernel and reboot before installing glibc.
 You may need to use "apt -f install" after reboot to solve dependencies.

Template: glibc/kernel-not-supported
Type: note
_Description: Kernel version not supported
 This version of the GNU libc requires kernel version ${kernel_ver} or
 later.  Older versions might work but are not officially supported by
 Debian.  Please consider upgrading your kernel.

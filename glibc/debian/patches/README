For the patch directory we follow this naming scheme:

  {ARCH|all|any}/{local|branch|cvs|submitted|unsubmitted}-"Description"
  
Branch means commited in the upstream branch.
CVS means committed in the upstream trunk.
Submitted means we're hopeful that it will go in.
Unsubmitted means we have not submitted upstream yet because patch is not ready
for upstream yet, but we want to eventually
Local means that it's not going upstream.

The goal is to get all patches to "Branch".  Patches should be split by
arch so that it's easy to send just the relevant bits to various
arch maintainers if needed. 

The difference between 'all' and 'any' is that the latter touches several
architecture dependent files (usually in the sysdeps directory), whereas
the former only modifies architecture independent files.  Porters are
supposed to have an eye on their arch patches and on 'any'.

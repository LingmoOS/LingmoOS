 1. This software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

 2. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented, either by

    PCRE in software that you distribute to others, commercially or
    otherwise, you must put a sentence like this

      Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
      which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright

    should also be given in the documentation. However, this condition is not
    intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
    it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
    A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE
    independently).

    misrepresented as being the original software.

   then the terms of that licence shall supersede any condition above with
   which it is incompatible.

 The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc" directory, is distributed
 under the same terms as the software itself.

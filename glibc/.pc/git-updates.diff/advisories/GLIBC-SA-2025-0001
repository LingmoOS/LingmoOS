assert: Buffer overflow when printing assertion failure message

When the assert() function fails, it does not allocate enough space for the
assertion failure message string and size information, which may lead to a
buffer overflow if the message string size aligns to page size.

This bug can be triggered when an assertion in a program fails.  The assertion
failure message is allocated to allow developers to see this failure in core
dumps and it typically includes, in addition to the invariant assertion
string and function name, the name of the program.  If the name of the failing
program is user controlled, for example on a local system, this could allow an
attacker to control the assertion failure to trigger this buffer overflow.

The only viable vector for exploitation of this bug is local, if a setuid
program exists that has an existing bug that results in an assertion failure.
No such program has been discovered at the time of publishing this advisory,
but the presence of custom setuid programs, although strongly discouraged as a
security practice, cannot be discounted.

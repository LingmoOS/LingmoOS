printf: incorrect output for integers with thousands separator and width field

When the printf family of functions is called with a format specifier
that uses an <apostrophe> (enable grouping) and a minimum width
specifier, the resulting output could be larger than reasonably expected
by a caller that computed a tight bound on the buffer size.  The
resulting larger than expected output could result in a buffer overflow
in the printf family of functions.

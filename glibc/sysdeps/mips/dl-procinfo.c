/* Note:
   When compiling elf/ldconfig.c, PROCINFO_CLASS is defined to static.
   This dl-procinfo.c is included in sysdeps/generic/ldsodefs.h.
   Afterwards, if not yet defined, PROCINFO_CLASS is defined to EXTERN
   just before dl-vdso-setup.c is included.  A "static" _dl_vdso_xyz
   function prototype would lead to gcc warnings/errors: defined but
   not used.  */

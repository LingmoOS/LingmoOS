/* For syscalls with side-effects (e.g read that might return partial read),
   the kernel cannot restart the syscall when interrupted by a signal, it must
   return from the call with whatever partial result.  In this case, the saved
   program counter is set just after the syscall instruction, so the SIGCANCEL
   handler should not act on cancellation.

   The __syscall_cancel_arch function, used for all cancellable syscalls,
   contains two extra markers, __syscall_cancel_arch_start and
   __syscall_cancel_arch_end.  The former points to just before the initial
   conditional branch that checks if the thread has received a cancellation
   request, while former points to the instruction after the one responsible
   to issue the syscall.

   The function check if the program counter (PC) from ucontext_t CTX is
   within the start and then end boundary from the __syscall_cancel_arch
   bridge.  Return TRUE if the PC is within the boundary, meaning the
   syscall does not have any side effects; or FALSE otherwise.  */

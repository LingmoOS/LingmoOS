0: Replace extlinux support in the original scripts with support for
   the live/install/advanced menu with splash.png

1: Generate a set of paths which cover each suite, each architecture
   and each task flavour (xfce, kde, gnome, standard etc.) as well as
   free and non-free variants of each.

2: Add the /install/ directory to the customise scripts as a common
   function and call from the customisation hook scripts.

3: Create configs for wheezy with adjustments to the extra packages as
   well as stretch.

4: Identify the package list of each current image and compare with
   vmdebootstrap EXTRA_PACKAGES list. Genericise the extra packages
   and isolate common from task-specific packages.

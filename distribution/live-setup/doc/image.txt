How to set up VM images for live/cloud build

20GB image

install basic Debian and set it up as a usable machine - booting, etc.

Enable serial console etc. - we might use it for debug.

apt-get install rsync openssh-server git dnsmasq \
 openstack-debian-images live-wrapper emacs-nox \
 strace eatmydata

Set hostname to make it obvious what the machine is.

Configure the mirror to point to the local mirror on the host - just
use deb.debian.org for everything, as we'll remap that.

cd /root
git clone https://salsa.debian.org/images-team/live-setup.git
git clone https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-wrapper.git

Install bits from live-setup/inside_vm:
=======================================

cp live-setup/inside_vm/flag_external /usr/local/bin
cp live-setup/inside_vm/flag_external.service /etc/systemd/system/flag_external.service
systemctl enable flag_external.service

add the host's ssh pubkey into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

Add fstab entry for the host-exported p9 fs:

host0           /external    9p      version=9p2000.L,nofail,noauto   0 0

Set up the external_flag service - this mounts the p9 fs and writes a
flag file into it when the ssh service is ready to use.

For the live image builders, add an fstab entry for the /w workspace
drive (300G or so):

UUID=<> /w              ext4     errors=remount-ro    0       0

(automatically) Configure dnsmasq - see the included dnsmasq.conf

Tweaks for openstack VMs
========================

Edit /usr/sbin/build-openstack-debian-image:

 * fix up the sources for security.debian.org if on stretch (sigh)
 * don't run qemu-img convert at the end - we run this on the host, faster

Tweaks for live VMs
===================

Bullseye is difficult. live-wrapper and vmdebootstrap are both
python2, so have to install buster, hold packages, upgrade. Ugh. :-/

In all cases, the live-wrapper package is missing some late
bugfixes. The quickest way to fix things is to replace the core
contents of the package with symlinks into the git clone in /root:

cd /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/lwr/
rm *.pyc
for file in *; do
    ln -sfv /root/live-wrapper/lwr/$file .
done

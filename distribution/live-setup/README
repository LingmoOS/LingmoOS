Setup for automating the debian-live image production on pettersson

The problem
===========

debian-live needs to run as root, and we don't like to do that on
debian.org machines. So we've set up a "disposable" VM to do this.

What needs setting up
=====================

Files in the "inside_vm" directory are things that will need to be set
up inside the VM to make it work.

How it works
============

Files in the "available" directory are scripts that will be used. We
need to co-ordinate things inside and outside the VM, and we do that
by copying the correct files from the "available" directory into the
"input" directory in the correct sequence. The scripts inside the VM
will grab scripts from the "input" directory when needed, and will
execute anything called "run-*". Those "run-*" scripts output
appropriate formatted log messages that the scripts running on the
host can grab and parse to see what current status is. The host
scripts can therefore see when state changes and copy the next
script(s) into the input directory, for example.

This is a crude method of IPC inside and outside the VM, but it
basically works!

How to start stuff
==================

To start things, there are two options:

 1. For a clean startup of the VM which won't run a build, make sure
    the "input" directory is empty, and run bin/vm-start to start the
    kvm instance. You can then ssh in via port 10022 to do management,
    debug a build failure etc.

 2. To run a live build, edit things as appropriate in the scripts in
    "available", particularly in "run-30build". Then run bin/run-live
    and wait for things to happen! You can also ssh in at this point,
    but be aware that the VM may well halt itself under you...

Future stuff
============

The next plan is to extend this:

 * actually make the VM disposable? Create and destroy on demand?

 * use a similar method for other things that need root access,
   e.g. live cloud images?

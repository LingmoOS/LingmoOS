Using Winetricks with non-default Wine versions
===============================================

Winetricks expects Wine in /usr/bin/wine and /usr/bin/wineserver. If you
want to use another version of Wine you should execute the following
commands before running winetricks, e.g.:

  export WINE=/usr/bin/wine-development
  export WINESERVER=/usr/bin/wineserver-development

If you have compiled Wine from source and installed it out of dpkg(1)'s
control, the winetricks package's depends wouldn't know about it.  To
install winetricks anyway, create a "dummy wine" package by using tools
in the equivs package before installing winetricks. An example:

  git clone https://github.com/jaalto/project--debian-wine-dummy.git
  cd project--debian-wine-dummy
  make
  dpkg -i wine*.deb
  apt-get install winetricks


About optional packages
=======================

The GUI requires zenity, but some of that functionality is also provided
by kdialog or xmessage (in package x11-utils).

For improved downloading install aria2.

xdg-open (xdg-utils) is used to open download pages if manual
interaction is required.

xz-utils is required by some verbs to decompress tar archives.

Winetricks caches *.iso files, if started with the -k option.  Later on
you can often mount them without needing root privileges with fuseiso or
archivemount.  Where this is not supported yet, mounting them requires
pkexec (policykit-1), kdesu (kde-cli-tools) or sudo.

If download sites, e.g. archive.org, are blocked in your country install
tor and start winetricks with the option "--torify".


32- and 64-bit
==============

Most of the software is 32bit only, so if you have 64bit OS, consider
setting:

  export WINEARCH=win32

before ~/.wine is created. This prevents Wine being structured as a
64-bit installation and allows winetricks to work. Refer to LP#1006909
for more information:

Winetricks' self-update
======================

Winetricks' automatic online version check and selfupdate is disabled in
Debian.  Although you may still run a manual "winetricks --self-update",
be aware that this will install /usr/bin/winetricks directly from its
developers, without any lookover from Debian.  What happens then, is out
of Debian's control.
Assuming the self-update only changed /usr/bin/winetricks, but nothing
else was changed by this subsequently, then a future update of the
winetricks package will bring back the regular Winetricks by Debian.
But again: Debian cannot guarantee this.

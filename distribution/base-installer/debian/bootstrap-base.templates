_Description: Tool to use to generate boot initrd:
 The list shows the available tools. If you are unsure which to select,
 you should select the default. If your system fails to boot, you can
 retry the installation using the other options.

Template: base-installer/initramfs/unsupported

_Description: Unsupported initrd generator
 The package ${GENERATOR} that was selected to generate the
 initrd is not supported.

Type: select
Choices-C: most, dep
# :sl3:
__Choices: generic: include all available drivers, targeted: only include drivers needed for this system
# :sl3:
_Description: Drivers to include in the initrd:
 The primary function of an initrd is to allow the kernel to mount the
 root file system. It therefore needs to contain all drivers and supporting
 programs required to do that.
 .
 A generic initrd is much larger than a targeted one and may even be so
 large that some boot loaders are unable to load it but has the advantage that
 it can be used to boot the target system on almost any hardware. With the
 smaller targeted initrd there is a very small chance that not all needed
 drivers are included.

 kernel later. This is only recommended for experts, otherwise you will
 likely end up with a machine that doesn't boot.

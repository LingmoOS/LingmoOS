  The support for FTP proxies has ended. You are advised to use http or https
  while configuring the debian package mirror, instead of ftp.

  The 'filesystem.size' file is no longer created and included in the image,
  as it is often incorrect and variates depending on the build environment,
  breaking reproducibility. For more information see the following thread:

  The live-boot mount points have been moved from /lib/live/mount to
  /run/live. Since this is a backward-incompatible change, a compat
  recursive bind mount point is being provided in /lib/live/mount so
  that existing scripts will not break in Debian 10 (Buster).
  Please note that this will be removed in Debian 11 (Bullseye) so
  plan accordingly and update any required scripts.

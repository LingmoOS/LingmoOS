# fake/pbuilder-0.228.4-1 -- emulate how pbuilder/0.228.4-1 would chroot.
#
# Please do not modify this script without verifying that its behaviour
# is still equivalent to the stated versions of pbuilder.
#
# This version has #841935 unfixed. It mounts /dev/pts, without explicitly
# requesting a new instance or a usable /dev/pts/ptmx.
# (There is of course a lot more that it does, but these are the parts that
# affect pty users like script(1).)
#
# Reference: pbuilder/pbuilder-modules, search for dev/pts.

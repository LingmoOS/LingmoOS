# fake/pbuilder-0.231 -- emulate how pbuilder >= 0.228.6 sets up its chroot
#
# Please do not modify this script without verifying that its behaviour
# is still equivalent to the stated versions of pbuilder. If a future
# version of pbuilder changes its behaviour, please copy this script and
# modify the copy instead.
#
# This has #841935 fixed (commit 4a4134dd). It was checked for equivalence
# to pbuilder 0.231, which is the version included in Debian 11 and 12,
# but the versions in Debian 10 and 9 have equivalent code here.
#
# Reference: pbuilder/pbuilder-modules, search for dev/pts.

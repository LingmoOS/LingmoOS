Subject: fixdep: Allow overriding HOSTCC and HOSTLD
Forwarded: not-needed

objtool always uses HOSTCC, HOSTLD, and HOSTAR, so we need to override
these on the command line for cross-builds of linux-kbuild.  But it
also builds fixdep which still needs to be native in a cross-build.
Add support for REALHOSTCC and REALHOSTLD variables which, if set,
override HOSTCC and HOSTLD for fixdep only.

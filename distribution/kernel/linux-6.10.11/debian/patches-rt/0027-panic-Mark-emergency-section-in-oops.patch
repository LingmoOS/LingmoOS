Subject: [PATCH 27/48] panic: Mark emergency section in oops
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/6.10/older/patches-6.10.2-rt14.tar.xz

Mark an emergency section beginning with oops_enter() until the
end of oops_exit(). In this section, the CPU will not perform
console output for the printk() calls. Instead, a flushing of the
console output is triggered when exiting the emergency section.

The very end of oops_exit() performs a kmsg_dump(). This is not
included in the emergency section because it is another
flushing mechanism that should occur after the consoles have
been triggered to flush.

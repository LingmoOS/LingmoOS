Subject: ARM: dts: kirkwood: Fix SATA pinmux-ing for TS419
Forwarded: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20170218003251.GC4152@decadent.org.uk/
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/855017

The old board code for the TS419 assigns MPP pins 15 and 16 as SATA
activity signals (and none as SATA presence signals).  Currently the
device tree assigns the SoC's default pinmux groups for SATA, which
conflict with the second Ethernet port.

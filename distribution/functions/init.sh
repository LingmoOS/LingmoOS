# "Auto" script redirection.
#
# As a matter of convenience users can have a set of saved commandline options
# which will be automatically included in every execution of lingmo-system-build. How
# this works is that the save file is itself a shell script saved in the config
# directory (one per top-level lingmo-system-build command in fact). When `lingmo-sys-build config`,
# `lingmo-sys-build build` or `lingmo-sys-build clean` is run, these scripts, if they see that an "auto"
# file exists in the config, they run that file, passing along any user
# arguments, and terminate once that ends. The "auto" script simply re-executes
# the same command (e.g. `lingmo-sys-build config`), only with a first param of "noauto",
# used to stop an infinite loop of further redirection, then a fixed saved set
# of command line options, as saved in the file by the user, then any
# additional command line arguments passed into the script. This is simply a
# means of injecting a saved set of command line options into the execution of
# lingmo-system-build.
#
# As for this function, it is a simple helper, used by the top-level commands
# to perform the redirection if the relevant "auto" file exists. It should only
# be called if the calling command script was not run with "noauto" as the
# first argument (the purpose of which was just described).

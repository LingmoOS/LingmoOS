      This is the main directory of the debian-installer project.
    --------------------------------------------------------------

It is coordinated on the debian-boot mailing list, debian-boot@lists.debian.org
(Go to http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe#debian-boot to subscribe).

How to get started?
===================

  To check out d-i, you will need Git, as well as the `mr`
  command. `mr` is in the `myrepos` package, or see
  <http://joeyh.name/code/mr/>

  First, check out the base d-i repository. If you have an account on
  salsa, use ssh:

     git clone git@salsa.debian.org:installer-team/d-i.git

  Or for an anonymous checkout:

     git clone https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/d-i.git

  Now run these commands to check out the rest of the installer, from git:

     cd d-i
     ./scripts/git-setup
     mr checkout

  Then see the docs in d-i/installer/doc. If you just want to build
  bootable images, see d-i/installer/build/README. If you don't
  understand something, post to debian-boot@lists.debian.org.

Daily builds:
=============

  See http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer for locations

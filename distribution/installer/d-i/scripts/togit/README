This is a work in progress. Plan:

* Checkout svn-all-fast-export into a svn-all-fast-export subdir of
   this "togit" directory and build it:

	git clone git://repo.or.cz/svn-all-fast-export.git

	(Apply svn-all-fast-export.patch* to it first.)

	Hints for building svn-all-fast-export:
	
	- Install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libsvn-dev
	- Run qmake to generate Makefile
	- Run make
  DONE

* for final conversion: lock svn repo for conversion; disable l10n-sync
  DONE

* Get a copy of d-i's svn repo from alioth, and put it in svn/d-i under
  this "togit" directory.
  DONE

* Run ./convert.sh (it can be restarted as problems are fixed by passing -r)
   Output is to ./git/
  DONE

* Run ./find-missing-authors.sh to find committers not listed in authors-file;
  if found add and redo conversion.
  DONE

* Run ./finalize.sh
  DONE

* Transfer git/* to /git/d-i/ on alioth, make live.
  (chmod -R g+rw on git repos; should all be in svn_d-i group)
  DONE

* Verifying the conversion:

  ./verify.sh init
  DONE
  ./verify.sh all
  DONE

* Run ./hooksetup.sh (this expects to find the repos in /git/d-i,
   and so should probably be run on alioth, after the conversion.)
  DONE

* Unlock svn repo.
  DONE

* Remove from the svn trunk packages that have been moved to git.
  DONE

* Add .mrconfig files to svn trunk; add svn ignores for directories
  checked out by mr
  DONE

* Check everything out into a d-i tree with mr.
  DONE

* Finally, create .gitignore files by running ignores.sh
  DONE

* Remove $Id$ keywords from files where the git equivalent (a hash id)
  doesn't make sense, and/or turn on the ident attribute in git for
  files to enable git doing the expansion.
  DONE

* l10n-sync needs to be made git aware
  DONE

* Add support for SILENT_COMMIT and [l10n] to git hook scripts.
  This will require some coding to get right.
  NOT DONE, but CIA has been confgiured to skip the SILENT_COMMIT messages

* Update the Vcs fields in control files.
  DONE

* Update docs in wiki, website, svn, etc.
  DONE

* All daily build operators will update their build trees to
  use the debian-installer git repository (which is what
  provides the installer/build/ directory).
  DONE ** except sparc **

* Everyone with an existing svn checkout will see 'svn update'
  delete most of d-i. (If they have uncommitted changes still in
  svn, svn will complain about conflicts.) They will run
  'mr -p checkout' to check out the git repos, and start using git.

* Encourage anyone who maintains patches on top of d-i (Ubuntu, etc)
  to publish them to git repos, or possibly to branches in our git
  repos.

* Update Ohloh enlistments

The scripts and other files in this directory are used for the daily builds
of the Installation Guide that are published on alioth.
As it is convenient to use the same infrastructure, the scripts also build
the developers reference for the installer (D-I Internals).

Some documentation on how to set up and manage the builds is available at:
http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2007/06/msg00625.html
There was supposed to be a part II about release management, but that never
happened...

The builds are currently run by Holger Wansing <linux@wansing-online.de>.

The scripts may be considered published under the GPL.

----------------

The build scripts source a configuration file in the user's home directory.
Below is an example of a possible configuration file.

<example ~/.d-i_manual_daily>
# Configuration settings for "daily" builds of the Installation Guide
# and the developers reference (D-I Internals)

# By default the manual is built and the developer reference is not
#DI_BUILD_MANUAL=0
#DI_BUILD_DEVREF=1

# The next setting forces a local build only:
# - built documents are not uploaded to alioth
# - changes to PO files are not committed
# - no mails are sent to translators, but the build overview mail is sent
#DI_LOCAL_BUILD=1

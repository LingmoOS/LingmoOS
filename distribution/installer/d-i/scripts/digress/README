This directory contains digress, the d-i automatic regression tester.

To set it up locally, you can edit the files here (but don't commit them!),
or create a directory elsewhere containing config and schemes/ and point
DI_TESTDIR at it. Once it's all working, the daily-tests script can be used
to log everything in a format that will let it be put on the test log page.

Warning about passwords: No real effort is made to keep root or user
passwords from leaking into the output or log files. Hashed versions of the
passwords will be put in preseed files. Don't use important passwords, and
don't put test machines on a insecure network!

The automatic testing is accomplished by the test-harness script. This
script reads global configs from the file config, and takes the name of a
test scheme. Schemes are defined by files in the schemes/ directory, which
has subdirs for each machine, that contain a common file with common
settings for the machines, and other files defining each scheme. These
files can set config options or use other schemes. These config options
should always be set:

extract locfg.pl from it and place it in your path or in the utils/

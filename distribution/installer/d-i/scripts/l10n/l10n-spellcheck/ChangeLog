	* First tag for the spellchecker created by fjp via:
	svn cp svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/d-i/trunk/scripts/l10n/l10n-spellcheck svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/d-i/tags/scripts/l10n/l10n-spellcheck/20050913 -m "Tag current version of spellchecking scripts (20050913)"

	Now development can move on as to use the sarge version of
	aspell on Alioth which will probably break things for a while
	
2005-04-28  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* Wordlists aren't built anymore at each run. 
	 "build_wls.sh" triggers a complete rebuild of all wls
	
2005-04-19  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* New version of the spellchecker has just been committed: the
	list of changes would be too long

2005-02-11  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* check_dit.sh: "check_var.pl" is now run with -s option

2005-02-10  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* check_dit.sh: added ".htaccess" in "nozip" dir so that files are opened using the right encoding

2005-02-09  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* check_dit.sh: Use of Denis Barbier's "check_var.pl" to detect wrong variables in strings

	* index_template.html: Added a few lines telling about the table

	* build_index.sh: "pt_BR" was always treated as "pt"
	Added "Suspect vars" column

2005-02-02  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* build_index.sh: added a column, for each language,
	containing the dictionary utilized

2005-01-27  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* check_dit.sh: master files are spellchecked only when
	necessary. This fixes the wrong unknown words counts and reduces
	the size of most ${LANG}_all.txt files.

2005-01-25  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* diff_stats.sh: fixed bug with delta=-1

	* lang2dict.txt: Norwegian dictionary was changed from "no" to "nb" which is the new code.

2005-01-24  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* "Plural-Forms:", "X-Poedit-Language:", "X-Poedit-Country:" strings are filtered out

	* l10n-spellcheck.sh : more fixes in order to deal correctly with symlinks. "latest" and "previous" now use absolute paths.

	* msgid_extract.awk: awk script used to extract "msgid" entries from "templates.pot"

	* build_index.sh : index.html displays the date in UTC

2005-01-20  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* l10n-spellcheck.sh: the name of the dir with all this stuff is not bound
	to be called "~/l10n-spellcheck" anymore. Removing all the ugly "cd" makes
	it more secure and flexable.

2005-01-14  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* README updated with latest changes

	* diff_stats.sh added to make it easier to track differences between different runs

2005-01-12  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* build_index.sh was added in order to build "index.html" every time "l10n-spellcheck.sh" is run

2005-01-11  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* Added support for "ga" language

	* Added support for "cs" language

	* Added support for the following langs:
	gl
	hr
	id
	mg
	mk
	nn
	ru
	tl

2005-01-10  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* "xtics" on the gnuplot graph are rotated in order to allow more languages to fit on the graph

	* Added directory "build-tools" containing the scripts necessary to rebuild
	a complete stand-alone environment (aspell, dictionaries, gnuplot)

2005-01-06  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* Fixed path in HTML table: now gzipped files are in "zip" dir

2005-01-05  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* l10n-spellcheck.sh: fixed the name of the stats file

	* check_all.sh: "graph.pg" is not kept anymore

2005-01-03  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* check_dit.sh: now results are save both in tar.gz and
	uncompressedformats (using "zip" and "nozip" dirs)
	
	Use "aspell list" instead of "aspell -l" for compatibility with
	future versions
	
	* check_all.sh: use "sort -n" 

2004-12-23  Davide Viti  <zinosat@tiscali.it>

	* l10n-spellcheck.sh: file used by crontab to run periodic checks
	on Alioth. It saves all the stats files in the "history" dir;
	besides this it keeps the resulting output of the last two checks
	symlinked with "latest" and "previous"
	All this output is kept inside ~/public_html/spellcheck/
        crontab set on Alioth at 13:00 MST (21:00 CET)

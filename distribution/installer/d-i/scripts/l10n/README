l10n scripts README, debian-installer GIT repository

The following files may be useful regarding the handling of
internationalisation and localisation in debian-installer.


grep-translators
  Usage: grep-translators [LANGUAGECODE]
 
  This script looks in the working directory for po-files and collects
  all translators together, sorted by language.
  
  If LANGUAGECODE is given, only translators for LANGUAGECODE are grepped,
  otherwise all po-files.

l10n-sync
  Usage: l10n-sync <D-I_copy>

  This script synchronises the translations in all D-I packages with
  the translators work in packages/po.

  Define DEBUG=Y for more output
  Define ONLINE="YES_I_KNOW_WHAT_I_DO" if GIT commits/updates can be made

  The use of this script is VERY DANGEROUS when used with the
  ONLINE variable properly defined. The script will then COMMIT the
  changes it makes.

  The only use for this script is for periodical synchronisations made
  by the D-I i18n coordinator.

output-l10n-changes
  Usage: output-l10n-changes <package-directory> [-d]
         -d: remove the .credits_log file after the output, 
             please use while releasing

  This script takes the debian/.credits_log (if it does not exist,
  log-changes is run to create it), outputs the changes in the
  translations since the last release in a form suitable for
  copy&pasting into the package's changelog. The script doesn't modify
  any files apart from .credits_log.

log-changes
  Usage: log-changes <package-directory>

  This script is intended to be run just after the debconf-updatepo
  run, to log the changed translations with the names of the
  translators. Logging is done to the debian/.credits_log file. This
  file is used by output-l10n-changes.

  You should generally use 'output-l10n-changes -d .' rather than using this
  script directly.

scan-trans
  Usage: scan-trans <directory>

  This script gets a list of all D-I packages with i18n material from the
  'packages_list' file maintained in packages/po and calls output-l10n-changes
  for those packages, to list l10n related changings.

gettext-helper
  Usage gettext-helper export|import <language_code>

  This script combines several .po files into on large file, or spread
  the translations from the large file into the small files.

  It will operate on all PO files contained in current directory
  subdirectories, no matter whether they are debconf translations or not.

correct-dates
  Usage correct-dates <lang> <di_repository_copy> <packages_to_ignore>
  
  THIS SCRIPT IS A HACK
  
  It is meant for restoring the PO-Revision-Date for all PO files of
  a given language. Its only use has been when the first few languages
  have been switched to the single file model without using
  l10n-sync --keep-revision switch
  
  It should be now useless but is kept for the record
  
  All PO-Revision-Date fileds will be restored to be the date of the last
  non-UNRELEASED changelog entry, except for packages given as third argument.
  The packages to be ignored should be given their full path relatively
  to packages/, e.g. arch/i386/grub-installer
  
switch-language
  Usage switch-language <lang> <di_repository_copy>
  
  Switches a language to the single file system
  
  Should be used only once for a given language

check_var.pl
  Has been integrated in l10n-spellcheck framework  

l10n-spellcheck
  This set of scripts allows for spellchecking the D-I translations.
  See the README file in the l10n-spellcheck directory

  Author: Davide Viti

l10n-stats
  This set of scripts creates the translation status pages.

  Authors: Dennis Stampfer, Christian Perrier

choices-check.pl
  This script checks the PO file in stdin and outputs all Choices-type
  entries for Select or Multiselect templates which have over 65
  characters for one of their components
 
  Author: Eugeniy Meshcheryakov 

websec/websec-txt
  This script downloads latest txt file with debian-installer translation
  status and send mail with difference with previous version, so only changes
  are mailed. This helps translators for monitoring changes of status.

  Author: Peter Mann

websec/websec-txt-all
  Evolution of websec-txt. It is aimed to be used by the i18n coordinators
  to run a "survey robot" which mails translators when one of their files
  needs an update. Must be configured by a file named "lang-mail.cfg". See
  example in the websec/ directory

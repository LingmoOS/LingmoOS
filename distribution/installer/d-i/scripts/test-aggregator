#!/usr/bin/perl
# This program downloads summary log files for the automatic d-i install
# tests, and constructs a web page overview. If you run an automatic test,
# add the info for your build to the list. 
#
# The url field points to the url info about your test can be downloaded
# from, the email address is a contact address, the description is a brief
# description of the test. The logurl points to wherever log files are.
# The logext is an extension that is appended to the log filename.
#
# In the log directory you should have a summary$logext file, that contains
# lines in the following format:
#    arch (date) user@host ident status [notes]
#    
# Where ident describes the test, arch is the architecture that is being 
# tested, date is the output of the date command at the end of the test
# (in the C locale), user@host is who did the test, and status describes
# how it went (usually "success" or "failed"). A log file for the test
# should in in the file named ident$logext in the log directory.
#
# Example:
# i386 (Thu Apr 22 21:08:03 EDT 2004) joey@home elephant-d-i success

# Note: only add items to the end of the list, do not reorder items or it
# will mess up the stats file used for the graph.

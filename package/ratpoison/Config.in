	  Ratpoison is a simple Window Manager. It is largely modelled
	  after GNU Screen and focuses on the keyboard instead of a
	  mouse.

	  The screen can be split into non-overlapping frames.  All
	  windows are kept maximized inside their frames to take full
	  advantage of your precious screen real estate.

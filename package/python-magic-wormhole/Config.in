	  Securely transfer data between computers.

	  This package provides a library and a command-line tool
	  named "wormhole", which makes it possible to get
	  arbitrary-sized files and directories (or short pieces of
	  text) from one computer to another. The two endpoints are
	  identified by using identical "wormhole codes": in general,
	  the sending machine generates and displays the code, which
	  must then be typed into the receiving machine.

	  This package builds and installs the Linux kernel driver for
	  the Mali Midgard/Bifrost GPU, compatible with recent Linux
	  kernels (>= 5.4). Note that it should be installed together
	  with the corresponding userspace OpenGL libraries, which are
	  usually provided as binaries only by hardware vendors.

	  mali-driver requires a Linux kernel >= 5.4.

	  luaossl is a comprehensive binding to OpenSSL for Lua 5.1,
	  5.2, and later.

	  It includes support for certificate and key management,
	  key generation, signature verification, and deep bindings
	  to the distinguished name, alternative name, and X.509v3
	  extension interfaces. It also binds OpenSSL's bignum, message
	  digest, HMAC, cipher, and CSPRNG interfaces.

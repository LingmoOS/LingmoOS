	  Duktape is an embeddable Javascript engine, with a focus on
	  portability and compact footprint.

	  Duktape is easy to integrate into a C/C++ project: add
	  duktape.c, duktape.h, and duk_config.h to your build, and use
	  the Duktape API to call Ecmascript functions from C code and
	  vice versa.

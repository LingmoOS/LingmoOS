	  ZynAddSubFX is a fully featured open source software
	  synthesizer capable of making a countless number of
	  instruments, from some common heard from expensive hardware
	  to interesting sounds that you'll boost to an amazing
	  universe of sounds.

	  Note: this Buildroot package does not include the graphical
	  user interface. It is meant to be executed as a headless
	  daemon to be controlled with MIDI events or network OSC
	  (Open Sound Control) events. OSC events can be generated
	  from an external system with the ZynAddSubFX external GUI
	  program zynaddsubfx-ext-gui.

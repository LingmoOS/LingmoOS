	  Crazy Eddie's GUI System is a free library providing windowing
	  and widgets for graphics APIs / engines where such
	  functionality is not natively available, or severely lacking.
	  The library is object orientated, written in C++, and targeted
	  at games developers who should be spending their time creating
	  great games, not building GUI sub-systems!

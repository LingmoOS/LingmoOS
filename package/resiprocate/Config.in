	  reSIProcate is a framework that aims to fully implement the
	  SIP protocol in first class C++. It is intended for use in
	  other applications, such as the repro SIP proxy.

	  By default this package provides the core libraries: librutil
	  (utilities), libresip (SIP stack/RFC compliant message
	  parsing) and libdum (SIP Dialog Usage Manager, a state
	  machine for SIP dialogs).

	  Linux D-Bus Message Broker.

	  The dbus-broker project is an implementation of a message bus
	  as defined by the D-Bus specification. Its aim is to provide
	  high performance and reliability, while keeping compatibility
	  to the D-Bus reference implementation.

	  It is exclusively written for Linux systems, and makes use of
	  many modern features provided by recent linux kernel releases.

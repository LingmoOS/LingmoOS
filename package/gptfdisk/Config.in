	  GPT fdisk (consisting of the gdisk and sgdisk programs) is a
	  text-mode partitioning tool that works on Globally Unique
	  Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) disks, rather than on
	  the more common (through 2010) Master Boot Record (MBR)
	  partition tables.

	  Install the interactive GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator
	  /usr/sbin/gdisk which is modelled after and quite similar in
	  use to the traditional MBR based fdisk tool.

	  Install the command-line GUID partition table (GPT)
	  manipulator /usr/sbin/sgdisk which is named after the
	  traditional MBR based sfdisk tool albeit with an entirely
	  different option syntax.

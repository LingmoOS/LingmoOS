	  Enable the OP-TEE examples package that brings examples of
	  implementation of OP-TEE non-secure client applications and
	  secure trusted applications. OP-TEE examples is a
	  component delivered by the OP-TEE project.

	  Trusted application binary files are installed in the target
	  directory /lib/optee_armtz as other trusted applications.
	  At runtime OP-TEE OS can load trusted applications from this
	  non-secure filesystem/directory into the secure world for
	  execution.

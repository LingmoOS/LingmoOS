	  Lugaru (pronounced Loo-GAH-roo) is a cross-platform
	  third-person action game. The main character, Turner, is an
	  anthropomorphic rebel bunny rabbit with impressive combat
	  skills. In his quest to find those responsible for
	  slaughtering his village, he uncovers a far-reaching
	  conspiracy involving the corrupt leaders of the rabbit
	  republic and the starving wolves from a nearby den. Turner
	  takes it upon himself to fight against their plot and save
	  his fellow rabbits from slavery.

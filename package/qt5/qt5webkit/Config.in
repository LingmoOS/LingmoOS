	  Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for
	  developers using C++.

	  The Qt WebKit module provides the WebView API, which
	  allows QML applications to render regions of dynamic
	  web content.

	  This package has been removed from the official release
	  packages since Qt5.6.0, but it is still available for users
	  to build it from source. This is useful for platforms
	  without GPU since the successor (QtWebEngine) requires
	  OpenGL support.

	  Memtest86+ is a bootable standalone memory test program.

	  Buildroot does not support packages with a '+' sign in their
	  name, which explains why it is named memtest86 and not
	  memtest86+.

	  Memtest86+ is a utility designed to test whether your memory
	  is in working order. It repeatedly writes an enormous amount
	  of different patterns to all memory locations and reads them
	  back again and verifies whether the result of the read is the
	  same as what was written to memory.

	  Memtest86+ will only work on 32-bit or 64-bit x86 targets. It
	  boots and autodetects hardware. Refer README.md for boot
	  options.

	  It can be loaded and run either directly by a PC BIOS (legacy
	  or UEFI) or via an intermediate bootloader that supports the
	  Linux 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, or EFI handover boot protocol.

	  It can be added to the grub2 boot menu by adding the following
	  lines to the bottom of grub.cfg

	  Example for legacy BIOS using the Linux 16-bit boot protocol,
	  with built-in support for USB keyboards or running on a serial
	  line:

	  menuentry "Start Memtest86+ (USB keyboards)" {
	      linux16 /boot/memtest.bin keyboard=both
	  }
	  menuentry "Start Memtest86+ (serial line)" {
	      linux16 /boot/memtest.bin console=ttyS0,115200
	  }

	  Or for UEFI BIOS using the Linux 32-bit or 64-bit boot
	  protocols, using USB keyboard:

	  menuentry "Start Memtest86+ (USB keyboards)" {
	      linux /EFI/BOOT/memtest.efi keyboard=both
	  }

	  Other boot loaders will have similar requirements.

	  Biosdevname is a udev helper that looks at various BIOS tables
	  to figure out what the actual hardware names are for Ethernet
	  ports and renames the ports accordingly. This has the
	  advantage of always referring to the same port regardless of
	  system or hardware changes that might otherwise alter the
	  typical ethX naming.

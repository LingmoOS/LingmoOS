	  The version you choose must match that of the aufs support
	  in your kernel. Usually, this is aufs3.x for 3.x kernels and
	  aufs4.x for 4.x kernels.

	  Usually, the sha1 of the cset you want to use; avoid using a
	  branch name as this yields non-reproducible builds.

	  See the following resources to see what versions are
	  available:

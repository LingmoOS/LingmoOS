	  A project in-between luv and luvit. The goal of this is to
	  make building luvit and derivatives much easier.

	  luvi extends LuaJIT with asynchronous I/O and several optional
	  modules to run Lua applications and build self-contained
	  binaries on systems that don't have a compiler.

	  The luvi core can be extended with several Lua modules by
	  adding its bundled Lua binding libraries.
	  To get the Lua module...
	    * 'rex' select PCRE (LINGMO_PACKAGE_PCRE)
	    * 'ssl' select OpenSSL (LINGMO_PACKAGE_OPENSSL)
	    * 'zlib' select zlib (LINGMO_PACKAGE_ZLIB)

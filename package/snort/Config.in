	  Snort is a free and open source network intrusion
	  prevention system (IPS) and network intrusion detection
	  system (IDS). It can perform protocol analysis, content
	  searching/matching, and can be used to detect a variety
	  of attacks and probes, such as buffer overflows, stealth
	  port scans, CGI attacks, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting
	  attempts, and much more.

	  The purpose of the Team driver is to provide a mechanism to
	  team multiple NICs (ports) into one logical one (teamdev) at
	  L2 layer. The process is called "channel bonding", "Ethernet
	  bonding", "channel teaming", "link aggregation", etc.

	  Team tries to provide similar functionality as the bonding
	  driver, however architecturally it is quite different. Team is
	  modular, userspace driven, very lean and efficient, and it
	  does have some distinct advantages over bonding. The way Team
	  is configured differs dramatically from the way bonding is.

	  If building the kernel with Buildroot, basic team support is
	  automatically enabled, but you will still need to enable the
	  modes you need, e.g. activebackup or loadbalance (e.g. with a
	  config fragment or a custom config).

	  cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library.
	  cereal takes arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them
	  into different representations, such as compact binary
	  encodings, XML or JSON. cereal was designed to be fast,
	  light-weight, and easy to extend - it has no external
	  dependencies and can be easily bundled with other code or used
	  standalone.

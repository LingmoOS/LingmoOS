	  Rygel is a home media solution (UPnP AV MediaServer) that
	  allows you to easily share audio, video and pictures to other
	  devices.

	  Additionally, media player software may use Rygel to become a
	  MediaRenderer that may be controlled remotely by a UPnP or
	  DLNA Controller.

	  Rygel achieves interoperability with other devices in the
	  market by trying to conform to the very strict requirements of
	  DLNA and by converting media on-the-fly to formats that client
	  devices can handle.

	  Most Rygel functionality is implemented through a plug-in
	  mechanism.

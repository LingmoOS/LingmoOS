	  GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is
	  going on `inside' another program while it executes -- or
	  what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.

	  This option allows to build gdbserver and/or the gdb
	  debugger for the target.

	  For embedded development, the most common solution is to
	  build only 'gdbserver' for the target, and use a cross-gdb
	  on the host. See LINGMO_PACKAGE_HOST_GDB in the Toolchain menu
	  to enable one. Notice that external toolchains often provide
	  their own pre-built cross-gdb and gdbserver binaries.

	  NPM is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.

	help
	  List of space-separated nodejs modules to install via npm.
	  See https://npmjs.org/ to find modules and 'npm help install'
	  for available installation methods. For repeatable builds,
	  download and save tgz files or clone git repos for the
	  components you care about.

	  Example:
	  serialport uglify-js@1.3.4 /my/module/mymodule.tgz \
	    git://github.com/someuser/somemodule.git#v1.2

	  This would install the serialport module (at the newest
	  version), the uglify-js module at 1.3.4, a module from a
	  filesystem path, and a module from a git repository.

config LINGMO_PACKAGE_NODEJS_MODULES_ADDITIONAL_DEPS
	string "Additional module dependencies"
	help
	  List of space-separated buildroot recipes which must be
	  built before your npms can be installed. For example, if in
	  'Additional modules' you specified 'node-curl' (see:
	  https://github.com/jiangmiao/node-curl), you could then
	  specify 'libcurl' here, to ensure that buildroot builds the
	  libcurl package, and does so before building your node
	  modules.

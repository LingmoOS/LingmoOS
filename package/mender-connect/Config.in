	  mender-connect is a daemon responsible for handling
	  bidirectional (websocket) communication with the Mender
	  server. The daemon is responsible for implementing a range of
	  troubleshooting features to the device as well as several
	  enhancement to the mender-client.

	  Mender Connect is loosely coupled with the Mender Client. The
	  main information passed between mender-client and
	  mender-connect is the device authorization status. Since only
	  accepted devices can interact with the Mender Server, the
	  Mender Client passes over DBus the authorization token which
	  Mender Connect uses to establish a Websocket connection to the
	  server.

config LINGMO_PACKAGE_IVI_HOMESCREEN_PLATFORM_VIEWS_PLUGIN
	bool "Platform Views"
	help
	  This plugin supports the AndroidView interface. Meaning you
	  can take any Platform View Dart code, change the definition
	  to use AndroidView, and you will have a working interface.

	  Benefits of using this interface:
	    - pre-defined interface that is supported in Flutter SDK
	    - params are easily augmented in Dart to add for given use
	      case
	    - pass touch to another process/library without additional
	      work

	  For a backing implementation there are a number of approaches:
	    - Have a PlatformView implementation render to a Texture
	    - Compositor Region support
	      (poke a hole for another process)
	    - Compositor sub-surface and manage Z-order

	  The above is already supported today using either an OpenGL
	  texture, or a Compositor Sub-Surface. Using Platform Views
	  just re-uses an existing interface.

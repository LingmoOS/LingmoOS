	  This project provides backends, filters, and other software
	  that was once part of the core CUPS distribution but is no
	  longer maintained by Apple Inc. In addition it contains
	  additional filters and software developed independently of
	  Apple, especially filters for the PDF-centric printing
	  workflow introduced by OpenPrinting and a daemon to browse
	  Bonjour broadcasts of remote CUPS printers to make these
	  printers available locally and to provide backward
	  compatibility to the old CUPS broadcasting and browsing of
	  CUPS 1.5.x and older.  From CUPS 1.6.0 on, this package is
	  required for using printer drivers with CUPS under Linux.
	  With CUPS 1.5.x and earlier this package can be used
	  optionally to switch over to PDF-based printing.

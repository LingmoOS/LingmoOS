# libunwind is only available for a certain subset of the
# architectures (as visible in the list of architectures supported
# with the glibc C library below).
#
# In addition to this, on some architectures libunwind requires the
# *context() function from the C library, which are only available on
# certain architectures in uClibc, and not available at all on
# musl. But on some other architectures, libunwind works without using
# the *context() functions, which allows it to be built with musl.

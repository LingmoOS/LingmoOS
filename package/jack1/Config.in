	  JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK 1 implementation).

	  JACK is a low-latency sound server, allowing multiple
	  applications to connect to one audio device, and to share
	  audio between themselves. This package contains the daemon
	  jackd as well as some example clients.

	  Another implementation (LINGMO_PACKAGE_JACK2) is also available,
	  please consult the documentation to choose the right one:

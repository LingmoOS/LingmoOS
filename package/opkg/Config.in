	  Opkg is a lightweight package management system, based on
	  ipkg. It is written in C and resembles apt/dpkg in
	  operation. It is intended for use on embedded Linux devices.
	  Opkg is maintained, stable, robust and conservative in its
	  memory usage, despite its buggy ipkg ancestry. As best it
	  can, opkg maintains backwards compatibility with ipkg and
	  conforms to a subset of debian's policy manual regarding
	  control files.

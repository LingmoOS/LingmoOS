	  Pango is a library for laying out and rendering of text,
	  with an emphasis on internationalization. Pango can be used
	  anywhere that text layout is needed, though most of the work
	  on Pango so far has been done in the context of the GTK+
	  widget toolkit. Pango forms the core of text and font
	  handling for GTK+-2.x.

comment "pango needs a toolchain w/ wchar, threads, C++, gcc >= 4.9"

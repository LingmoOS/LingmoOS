	# linux/nvme.h has been renamed to linux/nvme_ioctl.h since 4.4,
	# and the efivar source handles that situation. However, some
	# Sourcery CodeBench toolchains use 4.4 kernel headers but they
	# don't have that header file renamed, and that is causing build
	# failures. So, prevent this package to be built using those
	# toolchains.

	  The Frame Manager Configuration tool is Freescale PowerPC
	  platform software package whose primary purpose is converting
	  Parse-Classify-Police-Distribute (PCD) descriptions of network
	  packets flow into hardware configuration. The tool provides an
	  abstraction layer between the end customer's vision of the PCD
	  task definition and real hardware implementation.

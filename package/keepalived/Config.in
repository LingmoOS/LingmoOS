	  The main goal of the keepalived project is to add a strong &
	  robust keepalive facility to the Linux Virtual Server
	  project. It implements a multilayer TCP/IP stack
	  checks. Keepalived implements a framework based on three
	  family checks: Layer3, Layer4 & Layer5. This framework gives
	  the daemon the ability of checking a LVS server pool
	  states. Keepalived can be sumarize as a LVS driving daemon.

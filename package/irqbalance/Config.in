	  Irqbalance is a daemon to help balance the cpu load generated
	  by interrupts across all of a systems cpus.
	  Irqbalance identifies the highest volume interrupt sources,
	  and isolates them to a single unique cpu, so that load is
	  spread as much as possible over an entire processor set, while
	  minimizing cache hit rates for irq handlers.

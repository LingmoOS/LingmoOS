	  AppArmor is an effective and easy-to-use Linux application
	  security system. AppArmor proactively protects the operating
	  system and applications from external or internal threats,
	  even zero-day attacks, by enforcing good behavior and
	  preventing even unknown application flaws from being
	  exploited.

	  This package builds the parser (which can load profiles).

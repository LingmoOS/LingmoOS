	  Remote terminal application that supports intermittent
	  connectivity, allows roaming, and provides speculative local
	  echo and line editing of user keystrokes.

	  Mosh requires that the remote machine has a locale setting
	  matching the one on the client.

	  When using mosh with dropbear on a remote machine, the
	  client needs mosh with a version above 1.3.0 and the
	  --no-ssh-pty option needs to be passed when starting the
	  connection.

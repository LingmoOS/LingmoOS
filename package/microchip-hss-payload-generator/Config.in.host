	  Microchip PolarFire SoC Payload Generator. This tool creates
	  a formatted payload image for the HSS zero-stage bootloader
	  on PolarFire SoC, given a configuration file and a set of
	  ELF binaries. The configuration file is used to map the ELF
	  binaries or binary blobs to the individual application harts
	  (U54s).

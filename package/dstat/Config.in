	  Dstat, written in Python, is a versatile replacement for
	  vmstat, iostat, netstat and ifstat. Dstat overcomes some of
	  their limitations and adds some extra features, more counters
	  and flexibility. Dstat is handy for monitoring systems during
	  performance tuning tests, benchmarks or troubleshooting.
	  Dstat allows you to view all of your system resources in
	  real-time, you can e.g. compare disk utilization in
	  combination with interrupts from your IDE controller, or
	  compare the network bandwidth numbers directly with the disk
	  throughput (in the same interval).

	  Note that to get proper output, your terminal size should be
	  known by the termios subsystem. This can be done by running
	  the 'resize' utility of busybox.

	  A system daemon implementing the TPM2 access broker (TAB) &
	  Resource Manager (RM) spec from the TCG. It should be started
	  during the OS boot process. Communication between the daemon
	  and clients using the TPM is done with a combination of DBus
	  and Unix pipes.

	  The package also provides a client library for interacting
	  with the daemon via TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI).
	  It is intended for use with the SAPI library (libtss2-sys)
	  like any other TCTI.

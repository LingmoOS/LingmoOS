	  Dovecot is an open source IMAP and POP3 email server for
	  Linux/UNIX- like systems, written with security primarily in
	  mind. Dovecot is an excellent choice for both small and large
	  installations. It's fast, simple to set up, requires no
	  special administration and it uses very little memory.

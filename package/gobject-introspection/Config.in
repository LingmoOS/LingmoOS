	  GObject introspection is a middleware layer between C
	  libraries (using GObject) and language bindings. The C library
	  can be scanned at compile time and generate a metadata file,
	  in addition to the actual native C library. Then at runtime,
	  language bindings can read this metadata and automatically
	  provide bindings to call into the C library.

	  fswebcam is a neat and simple webcam app. It captures images
	  from a V4L1/V4L2 compatible device or file, averages them to
	  reduce noise and draws a caption using the GD Graphics
	  Library which also handles compressing the image to PNG or
	  JPEG. The resulting image is saved to a file or sent to
	  stdio where it can be piped to something like ncftpput or
	  scp.

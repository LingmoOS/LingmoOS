config LINGMO_PACKAGE_RLWRAP_SPY_ON_READLINE
	bool "spy on readline"
	default y
	help
	  If we want to keep the display tidy when re-sizing the
	  terminal window or printing multi-line prompts, we have to
	  know whether or not readline is in horizontal-scroll-mode
	  (i.e. wheter long lines are scrolled or wrapped). At present,
	  this involves a look at a private readline variable - if you
	  feel guilty about that, disable this option

config LINGMO_PACKAGE_RLWRAP_HOMEGROWN_REDISPLAY
	bool "homegrown redisplay"
	help
	  Some people report double echoing of user input. Enabling this
	  option will cure the problem - though the display will then
	  flicker over slow connections (cf. BUGS)

	  Prevent rlwrap from seeing multibyte characters as multiple
	  characters

	  The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable
	  cross-language services development, combines a software
	  stack with a code generation engine to build services that
	  work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python,
	  PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript,
	  Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages.

	  ImageMagick(R) is a software suite to create, edit, and
	  compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images
	  in a variety of formats (about 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF,
	  JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF.
	  Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale,
	  shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various
	  special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and
	  BÃ©zier curves.

	  Say 'y' here is you need ImageMagick tools (like convert)
	  to support SVG.

	  This is not enabled by default, as it brings quite a few
	  extra dependencies, and thus extra build time.

	bool "XML support"
	help
	  Say 'y' here if you need ImageMagick to support XML. Indeed,
	  ImageMagick does not trust unvalidated XMP profiles in
	  images. If such a XML profile is encountered inside e.g. a
	  PNG image the processing is aborted. Validating the XMP
	  profile requires that ImageMagick is compiled with XML
	  support.

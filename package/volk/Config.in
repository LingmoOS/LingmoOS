	  VOLK is the Vector-Optimized Library of Kernels. It is a
	  library that contains kernels of hand-written SIMD code
	  for different mathematical operations. Since each SIMD
	  architecture can be very different and no compiler has yet
	  come along to handle vectorization properly or highly
	  efficiently, VOLK approaches the problem differently.

	  For each architecture or platform that a developer wishes
	  to vectorize for, a new proto-kernel is added to VOLK. At
	  runtime, VOLK will select the correct proto-kernel. In this
	  way, the users of VOLK call a kernel for performing the
	  operation that is platform/architecture agnostic. This
	  allows us to write portable SIMD code.

	  A wrapper for the Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG or GnuPG).

	  The gnupg module allows Python programs to make use of the
	  functionality provided by the GNU Privacy Guard (abbreviated
	  GPG or GnuPG). Using this module, Python programs can
	  encrypt and decrypt data, digitally sign documents and
	  verify digital signatures, manage (generate, list and
	  delete) encryption keys, using Public Key Infrastructure
	  (PKI) encryption technology based on OpenPGP.

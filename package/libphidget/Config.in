	  The libphidget library provides an API for controlling
	  Phidgets USB devices. The library translates API function
	  calls to libusb function calls to control attached Phidgets
	  devices that provide GPIO's, DAC's, accelerometers, servo
	  motors, and other capabilities either singly or on combo
	  devices.

	  To use libphidget for controlling locally attached devices you
	  need to set up the userspace USB device tree /dev/bus/usb. See
	  file udev/99-phidgets.rules.

	  The libphidget library also contains an API for sending
	  commands to a local or remote phidgetwebservice using HTTP.
	  The phidgetwebservice then translates HTTP requests to
	  libphidget API function calls to control locally attached
	  Phidgets devices.

	  dawgdic provides a library for building and accessing
	  dictionaries implemented with directed acyclic word graphs
	  (DAWG). A dawg is constructed by minimizing a trie as a
	  deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and thus the dawg has
	  an advantage in memory usage. In addition, dawgdic uses a
	  double-array as a base data structure, so its retrieval
	  speed is as fast as that of Darts, a library for building
	  and accessing double-array tries.

	  FluidSynth is a real-time software synthesizer based on the
	  SoundFont 2 specifications and has reached widespread
	  distribution. FluidSynth itself does not have a graphical
	  user interface, but due to its powerful API several
	  applications utilize it and it has even found its way onto
	  embedded systems and is used in some mobile apps.

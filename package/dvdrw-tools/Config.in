	  The dvd+rw-tools are used to master Blu-ray Disc
	  and DVD Disc media, both +RW/+R and -RW/-R. Note:
	  The +RW in the name is a historical artifact. This
	  package contains the widely used growisofs program.

	  Buildroot does not support packages with a '+' sign
	  in their name, which explains why it is named
	  dvdrw-tools and not dvd+rw-tools.

	  Because dvd+rw-tools does not directly interact with
	  disc media it uses a separate media backend program.
	  The usual backend is mkisofs from the cdrtools package.
	  However, cdrtools is not currently part of buildroot.

	  The Linux From Scratch project uses uses xorriso for the
	  media backend and Ubuntu uses cdrkit for the backend.
	  Choose the one which seems most appropriate for your use.
	  NOTE: xorriso does not currently support UDF.

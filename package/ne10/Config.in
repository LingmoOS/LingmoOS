	  The Ne10 project has been set up to provide a set of common,
	  useful functions which have been heavily optimized for the
	  ARM and AArch64 Architecture and provide consistent well
	  tested behavior that can be easily incorporated into
	  applications. C interfaces to the functions are provided for
	  both assembler and NEON implementations.

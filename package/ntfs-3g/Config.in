	  The NTFS-3G driver is an open source, freely available
	  read/write NTFS driver for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, NetBSD,
	  and Haiku. It provides safe and fast handling of the Windows
	  XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000 and Windows Vista file
	  systems. Most POSIX file system operations are supported, with
	  the exception of full file ownership and access right support.

	  A glib/gio-based library providing some file management
	  utilities and related-widgets missing in gtk+/glib. This is
	  the core of PCManFM.  The library is desktop independent
	  (not LXDE specific) and has clean API. It can be used to
	  develop other applications requiring file management
	  functionality. For example, you can create your own file
	  manager with facilities provided by libfm.

comment "libfm needs X.org and a toolchain w/ wchar, threads, C++, gcc >= 4.9"

	  Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and
	  writes data across networks from the command line. Ncat was
	  written for the Nmap Project as a much-improved
	  reimplementation of the venerable Netcat.

	  A symlink to "nc" is installed if neither netcat or
	  netcat-openbsd is selected.

	  usbredir is the name of a network protocol for sending usb
	  device traffic over a network connection. It is also the
	  name of the software package offering a parsing library, a
	  usbredirhost library and several utilities implementing this
	  protocol.

	  Note: only the library is installed, not the utilities. Say
	  'y' below if you want the tools too.

	  If you want to serve usbredir requests on your target, say
	  'y' here to have the tools built and installed on the target
	  (including usbredirect binary).

	  Note: the tools are not required to use the library.

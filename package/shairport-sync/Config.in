	  Shairport Sync emulates an AirPort Express for the purpose
	  of streaming audio from iTunes, iPods, iPhones, iPads and
	  AppleTVs.  Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device
	  stays in synchrony with the source and thus with other
	  devices that are playing the same source
	  synchronously. Thus, for example, synchronised multi-room
	  audio is possible without difficulty.

	  Briefly, Shairport Sync keeps in step with the audio source
	  by deleting or inserting frames of audio into the stream as
	  needed. This "interpolation" is normally inaudible, but it
	  can be heard in some circumstances. Libsoxr allows this
	  interpolation to be done much more smoothly and subtly.

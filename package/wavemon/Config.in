	  wavemon is a wireless device monitoring application that
	  allows you to watch signal and noise levels, packet
	  statistics, device configuration and network parameters of
	  your wireless network hardware.

	  Note that you need a Linux Kernel configuration with
	  wireless extensions or with wireless extensions
	  compatibility enabled.

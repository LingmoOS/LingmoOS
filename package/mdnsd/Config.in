	  Small mDNS-SD daemon for advertising services and device
	  discovery, similar to Avahi and Bonjour.

	  By default, mdnsd runs on all interfaces that support
	  multicast.  It reads services to announce from
	  /etc/mdns.d/*.service, a few common services are included
	  below.  To override the defaults, e.g., path to services,
	  TTL of multicast frames, or the default interface, set
	  MDNSD_ARGS in /etc/default/mdnsd

	  Note: currently no NSS integration with GLIBC.

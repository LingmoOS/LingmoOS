Description: Common files for the Broadcom STA Wireless driver
 Broadcom STA is a binary-only device driver to support the following IEEE
 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network cards: BCM4311-, BCM4312-, BCM4313-,
 BCM4321-, BCM4322-, BCM43142-, BCM43224-, BCM43225-, BCM43227-, BCM43228-,
 BCM4331-, BCM4360-, and BCM4352-based hardware.
 .
 This package contains the common files and it should not be installed manually
 (it will be installed automatically as needed).

Description: dkms source for the Broadcom STA Wireless driver
 Broadcom STA is a binary-only device driver to support the following IEEE
 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network cards: BCM4311-, BCM4312-, BCM4313-,
 BCM4321-, BCM4322-, BCM43142-, BCM43224-, BCM43225-, BCM43227-, BCM43228-,
 BCM4331-, BCM4360-, and BCM4352-based hardware.
 .
 This package provides the source code for the wl kernel modules and makes use
 of the DKMS build utility to install them for the running kernel. The
 alternative package broadcom-sta-source can be used instead in case of build
 problems.
 .
 The wireless-tools package is also required in order to make use of these
 modules. Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

 This package provides the source code for the wl kernel modules. It makes use
 of kernel-package or module-assistant build systems. The alternative
 broadcom-sta-dkms package can be installed instead and might be easier to use
 with simple system configurations.
 .
 The wireless-tools package is also required in order to make use of these
 modules.  Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

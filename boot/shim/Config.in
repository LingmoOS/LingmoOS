	  Boot loader to chain-load signed boot loaders under Secure
	  Boot.

	  This package provides a minimalist boot loader which allows
	  verifying signatures of other UEFI binaries against either
	  the Secure Boot DB/DBX or against a built-in signature
	  database.  Its purpose is to allow a small,
	  infrequently-changing binary to be signed by the UEFI CA,
	  while allowing an OS distributor to revision their main
	  bootloader independently of the CA.

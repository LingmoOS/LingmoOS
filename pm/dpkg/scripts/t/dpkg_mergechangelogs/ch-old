test (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This entry should not have conflicts with Algorithm::Merge installed.
  * Changelog B should a have supplementary line above this one.
  * Pi is 3.14 is true for all changelogs.
  * Changelog A should have a supplementary line
    somewhere in this sub-list
    - The weather is nice
    - Yet I'm hacking on dpkg
    - What does that mean about me?
  * This line should be shared but the next one is dropped in B only.
  * If I'm here it's because the changelog is not B (I should not appear
    in the resulting changelog).

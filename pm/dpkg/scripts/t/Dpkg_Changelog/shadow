  * Debian specific programs fixes:
    - Re-enable logging and displaying failures on login when login is
      compiled with PAM and when FAILLOG_ENAB is set to yes. And create the
      faillog file if it does not exist on postinst (as on Woody).
      Closes: #192849
    - do not localize login's syslog messages.
  * Debian packaging fixes:

      invocation. Closes: #314407

      - Add a comment about "appropriate" values for umask
        Closes: #269583

      Closes: #298060

shadow (19990827-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Maintainer, with Guy's consent.
    closes: #22296, #22331 (closed some NMU bug reports)
  * New upstream release, closes: #15879, #24712, #25739, #28785, #32991
    closes: #38672, #39933, #41060, #42480, #22534, #12690, #36150, #26412
    closes: #40398, #43750
  * Ok, now for some dusting and house cleaning (aka The Bug Killfile
    Begins Here):
  %%- login package
    - Not a bug in login anymore, closes: #28098
    - No longer pertinent, and is not controlled by the login program,
      closes: #23155
    - This does not appear to be a bug anymore, closes: #32424
    - This is not a login problem. Xterm itself prints the LOGIN message
      and it does _not_ read login.access, closes: #16958
    - Seems to be fixed, closes: #28098
    - Huge list of "Fixed" bugs, that I want to close. I really need to
      start with a clean slate in order to get some of this cleaned up,
      closes: #3439, #11443, #13485, #13815, #15176, #15998, #16187, #17529
      closes: #17532, #17532, #18133, #18225, #20052, #20876, #21280, #21357
      closes: #21687, #21695, #21746, #21767, #22716, #24710
    - lastlog(8): Clarified differences in the usage of "login-name" and
      UID, closes: #26727
  %%- passwd package
    - newuser: appears to be working correctly and placing x, not !,
      closes: #19620
    - userdel(8): added note about user's mail spool also being deleted,
      closes: #20790
    - Can't reproduce this one, closes: #21639
    -  -e expire_date
          The  date  on  which  the user account will be dis-
          abled.   The  date  is  specified  in  the   format
          MM/DD/YY.
      Bug filer was trying to use an integer instead of the documented
      format, closes: #22533
    - chfn's command line options seem to work for root and non-root,
      closes: #25396
    - seems to have been fixed by the latest upstream, #25670
    - Removed references to shadow(3), closes: #32859
    - passwd only saves first 8 chars...duh :) closes: #33368
    - userdel can only do so much, the admin should know to check some
      things on their own, closes: #35418
    - Lot's of Y2K issues fixed in this release, closes: #37232
    - useradd requires the -m option to make it create a home directory
      if one does not exist, closes: #39581
    - useradd's -p option requires the password to already be encrypted
      as documented in useradd(8), closes: #39870, #39874
    - More "Fixed" bugs in passwd, closes: #13753, #16893, #17894, #18132
      closes: #18628, #12691
  %%- su (no longer a package, but has bugs just the same, will be
      forwarded to the login package soon)
    - Sorry, but su (all su's) invoke the shell with -c "cmd". This is
      documented, not a bug, it's a standard interface that su expects,
      go fix sash's bug for not supporting it, closes: #14551
    - Acknowledged NMU: closes: #20058
    - More "Fixed" bugs getting closed...CLOSED AT LAST, closes: #17593
      closes: #20057, #12689
  * Switched to a new build setup (dbs)
  * Split makes into separate files to make it a little cleaner
  * FHS compliance changes (usr/{doc,man} to usr/share/{doc,man})
  * debian/tar.c: removed
  * su: su is now going to be provided by shadow's login package and
    removed from shellutils (the shellutils maintainer agreed to this)
    in preparation for future PAM support. Added conflicts with older
    version of shellutils that does provide the su binary.
  * debian/control.in: removed the secure-su package since login now
    contains su and all of it's components
  * debian/control.in: modified the package descriptions to be a little
    more explicative of what they do.
  * Upgraded standards version to 3.0.1.1
  * Setup suidmanager support for all +s apps, closes: #15705, #15704, #15699
  * Enabled PAM. Support now for su, passwd, chfn, chsh. I am working on the
    support in login.
  * expiry: Changed to be installed as sgid shadow instead of suid root
    since it doesn't need root privileges. Also added man page expiry(1) based
    on the comments found in expiry.c.
  * Removed bashism's in control scripts. Now lintian clean (smells fresh too)
  * chage.c: Keep chage from locking when not running as root, since it just
    needs to read the shadow and password files. This let's it run sgid shadow
    instead of suid root. When run as root, it can lock files for editing.
  * login.c: Pam support Works For Me(tm)!
  * login.c: Fixed PAM's auth when PAM_USER was not set from the command line,
    also call pam_fail_delay() with FAIL_DELAY as the arg before authentication.
  * etc/login.defs.pam.linux: new file, reflects options that PAM takesover
  * etc/login.defs.pam.hurd: new file, same for Hurd
  * debian/passwd.mk: make sure that login.defs.5 gets installed for Hurd
  * pam.d/: Modified defaults for each service to reflect the old style and also
    added commented options on how to enable obsoleted options from login.defs
    in the PAM Way(tm).
  * debian/rules: removed --disable-desrpc from configure options since it was
    supposedly just a workaround for glibc 2.0
  * src/login.c: reset pam_fail_delay after every failure
  * debian/rules: remove debian/files on clean target
  * src/login.c: removed setup_limits() and check_nologin() usage when PAM is
    enabled
  * debian/login.pam.d,debian/login.defs.pam.linux: made notes about the pam_limits.so
    module, as well as pam_nologin.so
  * debian/su.pam.d: made notes about pam_limits.so module
  * debian/control.in: removed depends on libpam-motd since it is now in libpam-modules,
    also make login conflict with secure-su
  * debian/*: setup so that Hurd does not get PAM, since they don't have it ported
    completely yet.
  * debian/*: Final approach to a final upload, modified login.postinst to check old
    obsolete conffiles to see if the user needs a notice that they are no longer used.

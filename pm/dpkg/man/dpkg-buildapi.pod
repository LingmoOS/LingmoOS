=over

=item B<DPKG_BUILD_API>

The build API level to use.
This is intended to be used internally by the tools executed from
F<debian/rules> to avoid having to parse F<debian/control> multiple times,
and not to set the global build API level from F<debian/rules>,
otherwise build drivers (such as L<dpkg-buildpackage(1)>) cannot access it.

=item B<DPKG_COLORS>

Sets the color mode.
The currently accepted values are: B<auto> (default), B<always> and
B<never>.

=item B<DPKG_NLS>

If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native Language Support,
also known as internationalization (or i18n) support.
The accepted values are: B<0> and B<1> (default).

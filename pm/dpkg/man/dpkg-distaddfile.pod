dpkg-distaddfile - add entries to debian/files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dpkg-distaddfile>
[I<option>...] I<filename section priority>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dpkg-distaddfile>
adds an entry for a named file to
B<debian/files>.

priority for the
B<.changes>
file.

The filename should be specified relative to the directory where

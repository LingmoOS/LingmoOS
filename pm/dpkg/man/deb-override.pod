=head1 NAME

deb-override - Debian archive override file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<override>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

While most information about a package can be found in the control file,
some is managed centrally by the distribution czars rather than by the
maintainer in order to offer some global consistency.
This information is found in the override file.

The override file has a simple whitespace-delimited format.
Comments are
allowed (denoted with a
B<#>).

=over

I<package>
I<priority>
I<section>
[I<maintainer-info>]

=back

I<package>
is the name of the package.
Entries in the override file for packages
not found in the tree of binary packages are ignored.

I<priority>
and
I<section>
correspond to the respective control fields available in the .deb.
The
allowed values are specific to each distribution archive.

I<maintainer-info>,
if present, can be either the name of a maintainer for an unconditional
override, or else
I<old-maintainer>
B<=E<gt>>
I<new-maintainer>
to perform a substitution.

The override files used to make the official Packages lists may be found
in the
I<indices>
directory on any Debian mirror.

=head1 NAME

deb-extra-override - Debian archive extra override file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<override>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

While most information about a binary/source package can be found in the
control/.dsc file, all of it can be overridden when it's exported to
Packages/Sources files.
The extra override file contains those overrides.

The extra override file has a simple whitespace-delimited format.
Comments are
allowed (denoted with a
B<#>).

=over

I<package>
I<field-name>
I<value>

=back

I<package>
is the name of the binary/source package.

I<field-name>
is the name of the field that is overridden.

I<value>
is the value to put in the field.
It can contain spaces as the line is split
in no more than 3 columns when it's parsed.

The extra override files used to make the official Packages lists may be found
in the
I<indices>
directory on any Debian mirror.

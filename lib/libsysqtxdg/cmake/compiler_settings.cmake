# Honor visibility properties for all target types.
#
# The ``<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET`` and
# ``VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN`` target properties affect visibility
# of symbols during dynamic linking.  When first introduced these properties
# affected compilation of sources only in shared libraries, module libraries,
# and executables with the ``ENABLE_EXPORTS`` property set.  This
# was sufficient for the basic use cases of shared libraries and executables
# with plugins.  However, some sources may be compiled as part of static
# libraries or object libraries and then linked into a shared library later.
# CMake 3.3 and above prefer to honor these properties for sources compiled
# in all target types.  This policy preserves compatibility for projects
# expecting the properties to work only for some target types.
#
# The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the visibility properties
# for static libraries, object libraries, and executables without exports.
# The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to honor the visibility properties
# for all target types.
#
# This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.  CMake version
# 3.3.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior. Use
# the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
# explicitly.
